i don't understand whats wrong with me. i don't know why i freak out sometimes. like right now i'm just laying in bed nothing is happening but i can't keep the tears running from down my face. it's stupid. i'm honestly fine nothing is wrong. why on earth am i like this?,Anxiety
"usually when i have anxiety just chatting with someone or just having someone to physically be there for me is all i need to start feeling better. my anxiety is always worst at night, and it’s such a shitty feeling knowing that my girlfriend is literally sharing the bed with me but i still feel like i’m completely alone. i want to just reach over and wake her up but i feel like i’d just be being a nuisance. so what do you guys do when you can’t sleep because of anxiety but can’t talk to anyone because they’re all asleep? i usually just end up suffering in silence until the sun comes up and my girlfriend wakes up, then i feel comfortable and tired enough to go to sleep. ig i’m just weird, i can’t sleep unless i’m the first one to fall asleep.",Anxiety
"well, i've had anxiety and panic syndrome for a few years. it all started in my school back in 2014, my heart went insane for no reason, got so bad that i had to ask my dad to pick me up, we went to the hospital and my blood pressure was very high, years passed and now, 2016, the symptons got way worse, so bad that i dropped out. so, what's your story?",Anxiety
"for the most minimal of things, like standing in someone's way for just a moment. does anyone else notice this character trait? it's not out of habit, it's a subconscious quirk. i think, deep down, i legitimately believe i'm inconveniencing people when i say it.",Anxiety
"i stay away from family and live with my roommate who literally games all the fuckin time! it's like he is happy he doesn't have to go to college anymore this is a blessing for him. he has no other interests i'm stuck in my head all day! this pandemic really makes it worse for those who need distractions to escape from all the overthinking and anxiety! trying to develop new hobbies such as reading and stuff, watching shows and movies also gets boring after a while",Anxiety
"i'm very ecstatic, i got a job that literally fits around my anxiety! a family member of mine talked to anotger friend wjo works at an auto parts shop and she said she completely understands what i'm going through and the company will take me on! all i do is deliver parts and sweep that's it full time 8 to 5! not only that but they're accommodating for my group therapy!",Anxiety

"i quit my job today. it was fucking terrible. not quitting, but being there. from september, i've had the worst time working there and trying my best for an abusive relationship. it took every fiber of my being to go through with it, but i feel like i've shed a ten ton husk. long time lurker, but i had to make an account to post this.",Anxiety
"after months of being stuck in a loop of staying indoors and not stepping outside my comfort zone, i decided that i needed to challenge myself and do something that i haven’t done before. usually i go to the gym with my boyfriend, but even then, it has to be on a day when it is quiet, otherwise i feel overwhelmed. i had gotten kinda out of shape as i haven’t been to the gym now for around 3 months. honestly, i’ve been starting to get super negative thoughts about the way i look so i really wanted to change that before it gets worse. for me, working out is one of the few things that i actually enjoy doing! a bonus is that it helps me sleep like a rock. i kept telling myself that the worst that could happen would be if i get something wrong, and people stare at me- but so what? no one really cares about what others do in the gym. with this in mind, i managed a great workout session and i plan to keep it up. i feel amazing! taking small steps and even having the intention of doing something new is a good step to take. i hope you guys work towards doing something new today. ☺️",Anxiety
"i’m at a resort with my friends and their parents (i’m 17). so it’s just us and my friends and the bar crowd at this disco area in the resort and my friend pushes me to sing karaoke with him in front of an audience. it was fucking awful my voice was already raspy , yet i was somehow expected to carry the song. everyone was laughing at us as. we heard from our friends in the crowd how much everyone was roasting us and it was terrible. it was fucking terrible and i feel terrible. my friends don’t think it’s that big of a deal and told me “not to worry it’s whatever”. they even want to try again tomorrow. i feel like i’m crazy but no one is acknowledging just how embarrassing it was for me and how truly crippling social anxiety is when you’re in front of a large audience while everyone is laughing at your failure. i honestly want to kill my friends or myself at this point. not actually but i’m just super pissed and disappointed and embarrassed. no one takes this serious but me and it’s annoying because everyone just brushes it off and actually shares it to others. it’s just even worse when my friend choked throughout the whole song and i basically had to do 80 percent of a song i barely knew , with my already raspy voice and my anxiety in general. it was just disaster. pure disaster. i just want to disappear honestly. not even die or yell or anything. just disappear. pretend i don’t exist. turn into a wall and never come out.",Anxiety
"i'm always anxious, especially when i go out in the mornings and when i have to interact with people. going to breakfast this morning in a diner was a huge success for me. i brought a book, i had pancakes, sausage, coffee, and hash browns, and i was very anxious... but i loved it. i'm glad i did it. it was small step but a big victory for me.",Anxiety
"posting this is extremely nerve-wracking, but hey, i'm doing it! oh. my. god. i actually did it you guys! 6 months ago my psychologist convinced me to take an online english class... i was so reluctant and was about to quit more than a handful of times, but despite crying my eyes out my psychologist wouldn't let me quit. she knew i could do it, and i'm so thankful she didn't enable me when i wanted to run the other way. i owe this woman everything. it's been 7+ years since i finished school, and this is the only thing i have accomplished since then. it was without a doubt hard and it felt impossible at times, but i'm so proud of myself now - something that rarely happens.",Anxiety
"it started off okay, i was answering questions, trying to get to know the 2 interviewers. then the ceo of the company asked a question, i began to answer, and he kept interrupting me when i began to talk. this totally derailed my train of thought, stressed me out to the max, and i started to cry. i did regain composure and finish the interview but i just want to crawl into a hole and die. the thought of going to another interview, even at another company, and i start crying all over again. help.",Anxiety
"i love to grow flowers, it's pretty much my only hobby and the main way that i de-stress. i have flower beds all around my house and i view my plants as my ""babies."" but last year my emotional support cat passed away at 12 years old and i feel like my soul went with him, it was the worst pain i've ever experienced. in my grief i completely neglected my garden for the whole year. that cat was like furry xanax to me, and now that he's gone my anxiety has been at it's worst. but today i said ""no more hiding"" and i went back outside and weeded the beds, planted some more dahlias and lilies, mulched, and trimmed my roses. i even met the new neighbor without getting nervous and going back inside. now my beloved garden has its life back, and i feel a little bit better. now that i have new things popping up from the ground i have no excuse to ignore them. i hope i can muster up the strength to keep going. for today, i'm proud of myself.",Anxiety
"let me practice what i preach if i may... this morning, and most mornings, i fought off an incredibly severe bout of anxiety as soon as i opened my eyes. the rush of adrenaline and angst was nearly overwhelming. however, i took deep breaths, caught myself, told myself everything is fine, thought of 5 things i was grateful for and one thing i was super excited about and looked forward to in the future. soon after that my anxiety was gone and my mind was on to other things. i didn't give those dreadful thoughts any attention and i didn't entertain them. i simply let them pass and subtly replaced them with positive thoughts. i hope this can help at least one person to have a better day, or even a better moment to see that there's always a light. more positive posts would help all of us don't ya think?",Anxiety
"i’ve had the worst week of my life. pretty much lost the will to live. my anxiety has been at a all time high since i calmed it down a while ago. as seen via my last post i got sexually assaulted nearly 7 days ago and i’ve been going off the rails ever since. i’ve barely been sober and have been promiscuous which i’ve never been before and i have no idea why after my assault all i want it for boys to respect me and say the right things before any sexual activity occurs. i had a boy say to me he wanted to get to know me before we had sex even though it was a one night stand and if it wasn’t for that nothing would of happened between us. it gave me at the time some false sense of security knowing i’m worth something and i’m not actually just a disposable machine that’s only good for one thing and that’s it? i went out last night and i’ll spare the details as about 5 different events happened all absolutely terrible and a lot of people fell out but i got a message from a friend saying to come to a party and i ended up calling him, the person who’s party it was i had a thing with for 6 months last year but he messed me around and got on girls in front of me, so my mate went to pass the phone to him and he hung up, didn’t think he wanted me to go from the start and i didn’t want to either i was saying no to going for days prior when mutual friends were asking me to go then i find out it wasn’t actually my friend messaging me it was someone who clearly didn’t like me and wanted me to show up just to be turned away so luckily that didn’t happen... until... i went to meet my other friend hours later who begged me to go back to the apartment with him and i said until you speak to the one who’s apartment it is it not going like i’m pretty sure he doesn’t even like me although i never done anything bad to him at all i’m pretty sure i loved him but so my friend calls and he passed the phone to someone else who says to bring me and whoever else so we show up just to be told no i can’t come in. i feel absolutely humiliated, i know a few of them don’t like me that’s evident and i’m not sure why because i’ve not personally met any of them that don’t seem to like me, a lot of it has to be because of the guy i used to see and another guy i used to see who was also there. there was also drama as on friday someone slyly took a picture of me with a boy who had his arm around me who has a girlfriend (which i didn’t know) so everyone knows it’s me but they’re only not saying anything because the boy would fight all of them and probably win and his girlfriend showed up and punched him in the face and said he cheated on her, so i was quite a big topic of conversation in that apartment clearly and it’s giving me such bad anxiety i’m just worrying what people think of me and what was said about me i just don’t know what to do... i feel like i need to redeem myself but yet i’ve just done nothing wrong?",Anxiety
"i have this weird situation going on where nearly every morning now, after waking up around 3-4 a.m. i will be half-awake and trying to go back asleep, the problem is, that my mind is constantly telling me, your alarm is about to go off, you can't go back to sleep, and just all the things that run through my head before i fall asleep start to go through my mind. i am not laying awake with my eyes closed, but i am in a light dream with all of this going on? anyone have this problem too? i'm losing so much sleep because of it. update: happened again this morning. i was dreaming that i woke up and checked my phone and a girl replied, so was replaying a scenario of what i was gonna text back, over, and over, and over again. i finally realized that it wasn't actually happening and woke myself up.",Anxiety
"i have had fairly mild general anxiety for the past 4 years. it's always been manageable without the use of medicine. but recently, with a lot of stress and depression, my anxiety is spilling over into my social life. i'm convinced that, either as a result of my anxiety or because of the anxiety itself, every one of my friends is mad at me or can't stand me or even hates me. i typically don't care. i keep my circle small and typically i know the people i chose to have in my life love and care about me. but even that is crushing me. i have no reason to believe that my friends are talking about me behind my back, but i am convinced they are. i honestly don't know how to handle it.",Anxiety

"i've been battling depression, anxiety for about 15 years. i've also struggled with adhd all my life. on top of that i'm in my mid 30s and never been in a relationship so my self esteem is cripplingly low. lately at work my anxiety has been getting worse. i'm convinced that the people i work with think i'm a creepy loser and constantly talk about me behind my back and even text each other when i'm around. i'll dwell on it for hours and get a feeling of a knot in my chest. i also have trouble in social situations. i replay conversations in my head over and over again wondering if they found me strange. sometimes a memory of an embarrassing moment from years ago will just pop into my head and haunt me for a while. i've seen a therapist 4 times now but i'm starting to think she isn't equipped to deal with my issues. i think i may need to move to a psychiatrist and take a more clinical approach. i'm supposed to see a doctor next week to see if she'll put me on depression and anxiety medication, but i really don't know what to expect. i'm so tired of my mind going nonstop all day. i just want to stop obsessing over what people think of me.",Anxiety
"just like the title says, i have all these crazy thoughts and shit but when it comes down to it everything is fine. sometimes my anxiety is strong enough to drop out altogether. it's so weird. juggling like 2 thoughts but yeah, anyone experience this too?",Anxiety
how do people cope?! my anxiety is like “you have a deadline” and my depression is like “it’d be really nice to just lay here all day”. it’s to the point where i’m submitting coursework an hour before it’s due because i have almost zero motivation but still get stressed because of the anxiety. i’ve been on propranolol and citalopram for about 11 weeks. the propranolol is great for the physical symptoms of anxiety but citalopram is doing nothing for my depression.,Anxiety
"my anxiety is new. never had it before 4-5 weeks ago (just turned 24 years old) and it's been a terrifying process to go through. starting with heart palpitations, chest tightness and shortness of breath i had every heart/lung test you can have and have come out clean on everything. doctor thought it might be anxiety. i don't know what triggers it, how long it will last or how to fix it yet, but just know that everyone posting here and sharing everything gives me comfort that this is manageable and that some of the physical symptoms i feel are totally normal and that i'm most likely not dying. tl;dr your sharing makes me feel normal and reminds me that i'm most likely not dying.",Anxiety

"good morning y’all. i’m currently on my way to my very first day at work and it’s nerve-racking to say the least! i’m all different types of emotions right now. happy, excited, and nervous as hell. anyway, my job is as an it person and i have to assist customers with tech problems over the phone. i’m in a small, open office and i hate talking on the phone when people are right next to me. i just hate when people are listening to me talk over the phone, it makes me super anxious. but, i’m going to power through today. i hope it goes well and i can get through it because it would be a huge milestone for me. edit: wow. thank you guys so much. i kept rereading these throughout the day at points and you all made me feel so much better. the day went well!",Anxiety
"this is really just a note to myself. i consider myself a pretty smart guy. i knew the word ""anxiety"". i knew what it meant. i know people with anxiety issues. heck anxiety runs deep in my family tree. for some reason i never made the connection to myself. i finally have a word for how i feel. now things in my life make a little more sense. now i can start dealing with my thoughts/feelings in appropriate ways.",Anxiety
"one of the biggest fears of my life is getting scolded. i fear getting scolded more than i fear my future career. even if i know, deep down, that the other person is nice and probably understanding, i get so nervous about it that it affects my ability to do work. i submitted something in late and i was so sure my boss was going to blow up on me that i paced around for hours at home, but he called and was very understanding. it's exhausting having to live life as a panicky mess. i was scolded once by a strict coach when i was 15 and it took me actual years to get over it. after that one encounter, i was so scared that i would get heart palpitations and have to be physically forced to go to practice.",Anxiety

"i adopted my cat as a kitten when i was in grad school. i would not be where i am in my life without his love. pets hold a special place for people with anxiety. he was there providing comfort when i had bad days. he gave me purpose when i felt i had none. he gave me unconditional love. i didn’t have to worry about my insecurities around him. he loved me as i was. he was with me when i hit my rock bottom. he was with me during my years long recovery cheering me on and providing support during the low times. he gave me companionship when i would isolate because the world was too much to take. he was my spirit animal. he had anxiety too and took prozac. he was excited when i got home and would cry when i left, sometimes when i even just left the room. he loved me and i loved him and i will forever miss him and cherish the blessing he was in my life.",Anxiety
"for some reason i've already hated babers and getting my hair cut, maybe it's the masculine culture behind it or something. anyway i'm the type of person who would get 1 cut a year, when my hair gets long, my anxiety increases and i'm too anxious to even get a haircut. yesterday i found a men's stylist with an online booking, which was perfect as it meant no calling or waiting around for a cut. had the cut today and it was the best hair cut experience i've ever had, my hair now looks good and my confidence has skyrocketed, like everything since getting that cut has been amazing. although getting a cut might not be a big deal to some of you, i thought i'd share anyway to give you an uplifting story :)",Anxiety

"was at a con. there was an event. it was *very* full and i felt super overwhelmed. a friend asked if i was okay and i started to have a panic attack. he lead me to a side room. asked if i wanted space. said yes. sat there for some time. friend came back in to check on me. i said the attack was over and i felt out of it. said i'd go to the shop and get a drink. when i get back, my boyfriend is coming out the door. he hugs me and explains they thought i'd disappeared and hurt myself. there was a miscommunication and somehow, all anyone seemed to know was that i felt overwhelmed befits the game and looked kind of out of it. boyfriend was terrified and kinda angry that i didn't tell him. was hurt that i didn't tell him. but honestly, i was thinking only of the panic during the attack. apparently i was out of it for at least an hour, then went to get a drink while still out of it so i wasn't thinking straight. i caused an event to be interrupted, scared many people, and i'm humiliated. i feel like such a piece of shit.",Anxiety
"i have a question because i'm not sure if this is just me. i've always had social anxiety, even since i was a really little kid. the farthest back i can remember having anxiety about interacting with people was around 5yo. i remember around 13, i wouldn't be able to walk down the same sidewalk if someone was coming the other way. i'd cross the street so i wouldn't have to interact with them. now for my adult life, i'm still experiencing it i think. i talk to people easily now but i have something i can only describe as a rebound effect. i can talk to someone and have a really great conversation but then for the next few days have anxiety and panic attacks because i feel almost like i gave too much of myself away, even if the conversation was totally normal. it's not like i become very vulnerable at all. it's like if anyone knows anything more than bare basics about me or my perspectives or behaviors, i feel like i have to hide from the world. does anyone else experience this? i'm definitely going to talk to my therapist about it next time i see him, but i wanted some advice.",Anxiety
"i feel alone and useless unless i'm high or drunk. i might be failing classes at this point, or at least close to, but i can't go to class unless i'm on something without feeling like i want to kill myself or just give up completely. i'm even high right now, i haven't been sober in over a week.",Anxiety
"like i can have 5 consecutive great days of my baseline anxiety being very manageable (like a 2/10) then i relax and chill all day in bed netflix binging. by the end of the day my anxiety starts slowly escalating and now i'm at like a 7/10 anxiety wise. and i didnt do anything but relax all day yet this adrenaline builds up. makes no sense. theres no external stimulus causing me anxiety through the day (im watching tv or videogaming) so why is it ramping u... anyone get this, or understand why this happens?",Anxiety
"i needed to sell a university textbook as i' am desperate for cash and unable to work. i sent my first parcel after all these years of fearing the post office, and even spoke to the guy at the counter who was probably wondering why i was shaking so much. i'm proud of myself, even if it took me hours and a panic attack to mentally prepare myself to go.",Anxiety

"i have had 5 jobs in the last 4 years. i quit every single one of them, usually within a week of commencing. the longest i’ve stayed in a job has been 6 weeks. employment has been my biggest hurdle in my adult life. i become so anxious at work, i start to panic and lose the ability to concentrate. my body goes into fight or flight and i just simply run away and don’t look back. then the guilt, and depression hits me hard. after a good two years of no employment and being on horrible government benefits that constantly threatened to cut and suspended my payments due to not being seen as disabled enough to not work due to my mental health.... i’ve finally had enough. i took my own steps, i went out of my way and i applied for a job in a hospital. i got an interview and have been accepted and started just today! i have a week of training and then it’s all me looking after a ward. i’ll be doing the afternoon/night shift 3 days a week as an administrator maintaining paper work and discharging/admitting patients. my employer is well aware of my hurdles with my mental health and said she is very supportive so fingers crossed i can keep at this and build my confidence up! i know i will have my ups and downs, the anxiety will hit me hard some days more than others but i just have to remember how good working is for my mind and how we all start somewhere. i am proud of myself, it’s so good to be able to say that for the first time in a long time. thank you everyone on this subreddit for being so supportive. i hope to read lots of progress stories on here :)",Anxiety
"i haven't beat my anxiety, and i don't think that is ever possible. it's important to understand that anxiety is natural, and everyone experiences it; anxiety is a human emotion and it is natural to feel it. for some of us, it can be detrimental to our life however. i apologize if there are any grammatical or spelling errors. tl;dr: eat varied vegetables, exercise everyday, meditate, detach yourself from mental clutter, be aware of your drug intake, pay attention to the moment, engage in flow, seek anxiety and confront it. **nutrition** you are what you eat. if you are neglecting your diet you are neglecting your mind. personally, i have had a lot of success by implementing certain foods and being aware of the effect that these foods have on my body. tl;dr: eat vegetables, supplement magnesium ,abstain from caffeine or supplement l-theanine, learn about your gut microbiome, consume less sugar and eat more vegetables, consume sufficient fats. * magnesium: magnesium relaxes the body and helps contribute to a healthy electrolyte balance. personally, i noticed a severe reduction in my tremors and baseline anxiety level once i started to supplement magnesium glycinate. * caffeine: this appears to be obvious, but i feel like a lot of people do not think about this. excessive caffeine levels increase the amount of mental noise i have, which results in higher levels of anxiety. * l-theanine: a natural amino acid that is found in green tea. if you do choose to consume caffeine, combine 200mg theanine with your caffeine dosage to help combat any anxiety. also works splendidly as a study aid. * gut microbiome: i am not going to pretend to thoroughly understand this complicated system. but, from my understanding we have a second ""brain"" in our stomach. the bacteria that we choose to feed within our stomach has a feedback system, which fuels certain cravings and can change our mental state. this is why your anxiety may peak after a round of anti-biotics, you have eliminated all the bacteria in your stomach, and if you eat a diet rich in sugars or simple carbs you will have fed the bad bacteria. if your gut is populated by these bad bacteria, it will have repercussions on your mental health. * microbiome practical advice: consume more fiber and vegetables to feed good bacteria. consume more probiotics rich foods such as kimchi, kefir, saurkraut, and kombucha. favoid simple carbohydrates such as sugars, white bread, etc. avoid alcohol. consider supplementing a probiotics, examine.com is a fantastic resource to find the right supplement for you. **lifestyle** tl;dr: exercise every day, no matter what you do; meditate every day; assess your drug use and understand if you are using them as a tool or a escape. * exercise: start exercising more. in the slight edge the author jeff olson talks about momentum, and consistency. your goals are just do something, every single day. it is alright if you have a terrible workout, or if you only did a 15 minute walk. the goal is to create habits in regards to exercise, which will be easier to do if you reinforce this habit every day. on days that i really do not want to go to the gym, i tell myself that i only need to walk in and start doing one lift, if i still want to leave, i let myself leave. * **meditation**: key! anxiety comes from repeated negative thought loops, and a rejection of emotions. if i tell you that you can think about anything, but do not think about a white polar bear, you will find it almost impossible to not give the polar bear attention. by resisting the idea of a polar bear, you are forced to pay attention to it. anxiety works the same way. when you try to force a thought out of your head, you give it attention, which creates a negative thought loop. meditation allows us to practice being mindful. instead of thinking about our anxiety or the negative thought, you divert your attention to the sense (hearing, sight, physical sensations). this allows us to acknowledge the negative thought, and move on. * meditation continued: there a two types of thinking going on. you have mental noise: these are thoughts that arise spontaneously and we have no control over. for some people these are very negative. behind this mental noise we have the observer however, this is you. when you are engaged in a activity that creates flow, your mental noise is reduced, and the observer has complete control. engaging in mediation allows us to get in contact with this observer, separating us from our mental noise. * drug use: this is a complicated subject, and if you do choose to consume drugs please make sure to properly educated yourself through erowid, or the different subreddits here. drugs take away what they give you. if you are consuming marijuana to run from your negative feelings, you may find that you are unable to cope with them sober. personally, i know that weed significantly contributes towards my anxiety. it causes me to overthink and sit in my head, rather than in the environment around me. mushrooms, lsd, and dmt have been the most effective means for me to solve my anxiety. if you choose to consume these drugs however, please be aware that these are powerful psychoactive substances that can have repercussions on your mental well being. physically, they are incredibly safe. personally, they allowed me to view my life free from the ego, which let me adopt a healthier mindset. if you are using drugs (which includes alcohol) to escape your negative feelings, you are not solving the problem. it is in the background, unsolved and growing. **techniques** tl;dr: try to observe your thoughts, engage in flow, take time to be mindful about your physical sensations, separate the observer and the mind. * noting: this creates a barrier between the observer, and your mental noise. when you feel anxiety, be aware of the physical sensations. think ""this is my body feeling anxiety, my bodies faces is flushed, my hands are shaking, and there is a pressure in the back of my head"". this allows you to understand that your body and mind may act seperately. * you are not your thoughts: your thoughts are not completely true and are built upon heuristics. just because you believe that your coworkers are talking about you, this does not make it true. our brains are incredible, but they are oftentimes inaccurate. * mindfulness: again, the goal is to dwell less in our brains, and focus more on the present moment. there is no past or future, the only thing that truly exists is the present moment. when your anxiety is peaking, take time to focus on the sensation of your breath, rub your fingers together and be aware of the feeling, do anything that grounds you with your physical sensation. * watch your brain: take the time every day to just let your brain think. don't try to control your thoughts or empty your brain, just wait and see what your next thought will be. if it is negative, don't reject the thought. follow the thought as far as your mind wants to, and move on when you notice another thought arise. again, this creates a barrier between you and your mind. * flow: have you ever played a game where you are completely in the moment? maybe the ball was just thrown to you, and your body seems to react automatically. this is flow, and it is a important part of our mental well-being. you can achieve this state through many different activities, take the time to find the ones that you can find flow in. **the importance of fear**: courage isn't the absence of fear, but the ability to recognize your fear and act anyway. by engaging in activities that give you anxiety, you will find that your anxiety is often times unfounded. this sounds difficult, but honestly the best thing you can do with your anxiety is to push yourself. take baby steps, don't jump into the deep end. you will be controlled by your anxiety if you don't push the levels a bit. if you have social anxiety, start talking more online. make small talk with the cashier. find whatever baby steps work for you. **therapy**: you are not weak if you consult a therapist. please, if you are really struggling go and try to talk to some different therapists. they are generally wonderful people who just want you to live a happy, fulfilled life. **recommended reading:** siddhartha by herman hesse meditations by marcus aurelius the power of now by eckhart tolle the subtle art of not giving a fuck by mark manson the slight edge by jeff olson the feeling good handbook by david burns.

about 2 weeks ago i told my parents about my anxiety. i thought i'd let you guys know i am getting help from my therapist for the first time today. wish me luck!,Anxiety
"this seems to happen to me a lot. i was blessed with a kick ass immune system, but i'm always freaking out about getting sick, especially before a big event. i have prom on thursday and i've felt shitty since sunday from what i think are nerves. my symptoms are: -weak body (hard to describe) -lower back stiffness -nausea (but in my throat, not stomach if that makes any sense at all) -overall not feeling well but can't really describe the feeling. but it feels absolutely awful like i might as well have the flu or something -throat tightness -rushes where i feel like i'll throw up but never do (i'm severely emetephobic and have only thrown up 3/4 times in my 18 years on this planet, all of them &gt;5 years ago.) -not feeling comfortable unless i'm in my bed or in the bath -difficulty sleeping -feeling like i have a fever but i don't -tense legs -feeling helpless and like if i were to get sick no one could help me i think i have allergies right now but i'm so worried that it's a cold. i'm also scared i'll throw up either now or before prom or i'll feel sick for prom and have my day ruined. is it really possible that how i feel physically is really just all in my head and due to anxiety?? does anyone else get this? how can i stop it?",Anxiety
"every morning since classes started up again, i wake up, and after a few seconds, the nausea sets in. it almost feels like a miniature panic attack. i really hate it, it messes up the rest of my day :(",Anxiety
"i have been getting more and more panic attacks recently and my mum thinks i fake them to be dramatic and get attention. i was having a pretty huge one and she hit me over the head twice quite hard whilst calling me pathetic which obviously just made it worse. shes been hitting me since i can remember. she doesnt beat me on the regular just when ive really annoyed her which makes me hesitant to tell anyone. today i told my grandma what she did and she completely took my mums side saying ""sometimes a slap helps you snap out of it"" i couldnt be more angry as this entire conversation arose because they were talking about how to deal with my little sisters anxiety which is apparently all my fault. yeah the double standards when being a middle child are great... i dont know what to do ive been gaslighted my entire life not to mention my stepdad is a police officer. ive got no family members who will support me but i cant go one like this. my mum needs to know what she is doing is wrong.",Anxiety
"holy schnikes. i feel like a new man. i've been working non-stop for the past 2 weeks. today at lunch, i got so anxious that i went to the restroom and had a ""mini"" panic attack for 5 minutes. i felt so anxious all day. tonight, i hit the treadmill for 30 minutes, walking fast and jogging for a minute or two. i feel like a new man. it totally dialed down my anxiety. if you're not doing cardio, try it. it may change your life. **update: 17 hours later and i still feel great.",Anxiety
"i have a few things bothering me a lot at the moment and very much need some serious advice. when i was 4/5, i was sitting on my dad's lap helping him steer a car into the back yard, i suddenly felt something hard against my backside, he then asked if i could feel it, and i said yes, we then got out of the car. my mum then asks why he had an erection, he tells mum that i was sitting on his lap. she then starts to get jealous and asks what was wrong with her, and they have a small argument before she walks inside, leaving me alone with him. he then asks me to come towards him, with a very deivant expression, i suddenly felt anxious, and say no before running inside and going to my bedroom. he then follows me inside, and enters my bedroom. my mum and myself yell at him to leave me alone, him and mum have another small argument before he drives off. mum then comes into my bedroom later to tell me not to tell anyone about what happened, because people will come to take me away. then, when i was about 11/12 he would enter the bathroom while i was showering everyday, even though i expressed to him that i wanted my privacy many times. i asked him to stop, i asked my mum to talk to him. the bathroom door would be closed (no lock), but he would still come in. his reasons for entering would change, sometimes it was to wash his hands, to check his face in the mirror (which was located directly in front of the mirror), or to just have a chat because he hadn't seen me all day. i would complain to my mum everyday, and she would just say she would talk to him, or even said that i always showered while he was home so i must want him to look at me. these memories have been causing me a great deal of stress, but i'm confused about if they're serious, and if i should be worried about them? i have two young daughters myself now, and i'm worried about their safety around my parents. am i overreacting or do i have something to worry about?",Anxiety

"so in my bigger lecture classes, i generally keep to myself and the classes are so big that it doesn't make much of a difference. smaller classes i would stress out a lot more about it but in bigger classes, i just have my misophonia to worry about. but yesterday, my class got moved and i was walking into the building to look for is and saw another girl heading in the same direction, so i asked if she was heading to the same place and she said yes, so i walked with her. we walked in silence for a little bit, then i finally worked up the courage to try and start a conversation with her by asking what her major is. and somehow, we got to talking for the full 20 minutes before class starts! i've never had such a lovely conversation with a stranger so easily, and we connected on a lot of things. i don't know if i'll ever see her again because the class is so big, but i was just happy to have someone to talk to and this has never happened before.",Anxiety

"whenever there is a change of plans, i almost always feel an extreme punch to my gut. i typically end up making it worse by immediately jumping to saying i don’t want to do the plans anymore or getting upset with the person. it’s especially hard in my relationship. even if i’d be perfectly fine with having the night to myself, if it’s the same day change in plans i feel like i can’t breath or i need to scream. jumping outside my bubble, i know i’ll enjoy my time alone but my mind immediately goes to feelings of rejection, extreme anxiety, and the need to close off immediately. i just want to jump in a hole forever and find myself in a major low for the rest of the day. this leads to even more disconnect with my partner. in the moment, i feel like pinching myself or really biting my inner cheek. someway to get out the anxiety. have you all found a way to 1. get that anxiety out immediately 2. not hurt your partner with words said/finding peace in a new change of plans. any advice at all would really really help. i’m having a really tough time.",Anxiety
"the older i get, the worse i seem to be at, i don't know, functioning in general. i used to be really sociable, have plenty of friends, i did well in school, had hobbies and interests - i was weird, but enough people liked me that i didn't think about it. after high school it was like the blinders were taken off and i started to see all these things about myself that i really, really hated. i started struggling a lot in social situations, i flunked out of a really good university, i couldn't hold a job, i gradually lost contact with my friends... i was a mess. but i got back up. it was a little harder than before but i still had enough momentum to keep going. i moved back to my old school's city after a semester away, ready to do what i had to in order to re-enroll, but things got worse. i had a *lot* of anxiety already, and you know how people are - they pick up on that. i reconnected with my friends for a little while but then they all ghosted me because i was starting to act a little crazy. i got very depressed and almost did something irreparably bad to myself. so back with mom and dad. again. starting at another school. again. i got overwhelmed and started having panic attacks before classes and pulled out. i got a job and worked full time, but i was not good at it, my co-workers didn't like me much, and i was fired after a year. so i'm back in school yay. except i'm only in two classes and still struggling. everything is just... *so hard* and it's exhausting and frustrating and humiliating. i had high hopes for myself, but i don't see how to salvage any of that from what i've let myself become. i think a big part of my problems is that i'm so used to trying and failing that i'm afraid that's the only outcome if i try again. i look at myself and think ""i've given up,"" because i have. i don't want to! but i don't know how to make life work for me anymore. i don't know how to connect with people. i go out somewhere and it's impossible to think or talk clearly through the static in my head that makes me nauseous and stutter and my heart pound. what kind of a life is one where you can't even talk to someone without turning into an idiot or crying after? i can't function like this. i'll never be able to work like this. has anyone overcome a similar situation?",Anxiety
"i (26 m) am by no means saying that i still don’t feel anxious now and then but i have definitely regained control of my life. i am now living the life that i want to live. no longer is anxiety holding me back from doing anything in life i want to. i am going to try my best to list of a few key points that helped me get to where i am today i no for a fact that i am going to miss out a lot of information just for the fact that it has took a shit ton of little things to get me to where i am. taking time to heal: 1 year ago i made the hard decision to take a break from my toxic job to focus on my own health, this was a super hard decision to make but it enabled me to take the time i need to push myself out of my comfort zone and focus on myself. consistently exercising and eating better: i had no self confidence and was always exhausted so i used to eat junk food most nights just because i felt like shit and the food made me feel worse, now i eat much cleaner, no caffeine alcohol or sugary drinks stopped smoking especially cannabis, i still treat myself of a weekend to what ever i want but for the most part i plan my meals in advance and make sure i eat them throughout the week. and the benefits of exercise are well documented but could not be underestimated. sleep: this was harder than you might think for me and i massively underestimated its value, i have never been a good sleeper usually getting anywhere from 2/5 hours sleep a night was not uncommon, but after a lot of self experimenting what works best for me i have finally got it under control i am now getting between 7/8 hours a night and the difference is chalk and cheese, when you wake up refreshed from a nights sleep there is no better feeling. took a break from ‘soical media’: i deleted all social media accounts (except reddit) and to be honest i have not got them back and i don’t think i will, people portray an image of themselves to the world that they want them to see not their real selves, and it can make you compare yourself to other people which in my opinion is not healthy, focus on yourself. perseverance: not everything you try is going to succeed, over these 8 years i have tried and failed more timed than i could ever count, but i always try again the next day, small victories are the key, i would push myself every day to do something i was uncomfortable doing, some days i would fail but i would try again until i could complete what i had set out to do then more. take experience and tips and tricks from people who have been there before: there is an old saying i can not remember where i heard it but it goes ‘ no man is your friend, no man is your enemy, every man is your teacher’, and basically my interpretation of it is you can learn from any and everyone, and that is what i did i did my own research and reached out to anyone with knowledge about anxiety and panic attack’s and see what they knew about it that i didn’t. i am not writing this to gloat i am writing this so that if even 1 person out there who thinks there is no way out or that life can never go back to ‘normal’ i am living proof that there is, better days are ahead. i hope anyone reading this might find it usually or insightful and if you have any questions leave them below and i will try my best to answer as best as i can.",Anxiety
"felt horrible when i read the news, with the fears that many have about potential war. although i live in australia, i’m still scared about the outcomes. speaking to my dad, he reassures me this isn’t a global conflict (china and russia, and other major players being unlikely to join the war). nevertheless, i understand even a war between iran and the us wouldn’t impact me definitively but the fear of escalation is still tingling me even after the initial shock. i feel like i felt when i heard about the india/pakistan news a couple months ago. the same feeling of when ww3 was trending on twitter a couple years ago. knowing those have not led to the wars that people perhaps fear-mongered about is some respite from the aftermath of the panic. don’t know if i’m looking for people to tell me it’s alright, telling me the straight truth or telling me a white lie to feel better (what i think my dad does at times, or others in other posts). the rational part of me tells me not to worry about this, as even if it eventuates to my worst fears, i’ll be worrying about it twice. with a pretty important interview in a couple of days, i’m trying to stick that, but not sure how i’ll cope as more news comes out (although i’m making myself keep off it).",Anxiety

"anyone else deal with this? in short, i always envision these scenarios that are horrible in my head. i envision them even when the facts i'm presented with don't back them up. i could even have the people involved in these scenarios tell me things are cool, yet i still can't get over these thoughts. they're a ridiculous burden. here's a perfect example, i'm self employed. yesterday morning i had a client question some work i did for him, he asked me to put together an email explaining things. i said i would and i did; i sent him the email yesterday. this morning i followed up with him. his exact words to me, ""everything makes sense to me. thank you. i'll pass it along and it'll make sense to them too."" that should, realistically, be the end of my thinking. the guy i was worrying about just told me everything was fine and that what i said made sense. instead of relaxing, i think these things : - ""he's not telling the truth, he's conspiring against me and just wants to make me feel safe. they're secretly unhappy and questioning me."" - ""his company is going to sue me, they're talking about going after me and just not telling me."" *i then begin to play out these overly detailed lawsuits in my head, even going through the conversations i would have with him about the lawsuit.* - ""he's going to drag my name through the mud and my business will go under."" - ""when my business goes under it's going to hurt my marriage, and my wife won't be happy ..."" i could go on and on. i literally had to sit on my couch last night trying to calm myself down because of this. all of this is stuff i build up, i know this, yet i can't deal with it rationally. i know full well that the facts i have don't back up my ridiculous thinking, yet it doesn't go away. anyone else deal with this? how do you manage/cope?",Anxiety
"i'm a programmer who just started working at a tech startup. i've also been working with a therapist to help manage my panic disorder for a few years. this job is not at all what i expected. i was told that it had a pretty good work-life balance, but for the last 2 months we've been expected to get in at 9 and work until much later than 9 in the evening. lots of people are sleeping in the office because they have to stay in so late, and when people start leaving for the night, the ceo sends out emails about how if we worked smarter we wouldn't have to work so late, and that he expects to see everyone giving 110% first thing in the morning. because of the hours i haven't been able to see my family or girlfriend very much since i started. i've also been dealing with some insurance issues (on my therapist's side, our company hr has done everything right) and that's made things worse. i've been having panic attacks most days in the office and today i had one at the thought of going back in to deal with this stuff again tomorrow. i know that something needs to change here but i don't have any faith that it will. from what i've heard, the ceo won't approve any new hires because he sincerely thinks that we can get everything done in a 9-5 work week. i don't really know what to do. i'm not sure if i'm mishandling things because i haven't seen my therapist in a while and i don't know how to bring this up with my boss. i've heard from him that people are wondering why i got to leave early for my therapy appointments (when i had them) and they seem unwilling to discuss accommodations. i don't know how to handle this situation and i don't know what to do if i get fired. can anyone help me?",Anxiety
"hello all, i'm currently in a relationship with my boyfriend of 5 years. sometimes, i get so overwhelmed by how happy he makes me and how much i love him, that i get terrified. for some reason i feel like what we have is too good to be true, and i feel like the universe is going to try to get back at me, and something tragic is going to happen to him. i always have intrusive thoughts about him getting killed, or getting in an accident. it's awful and sometimes it prevents from being fully present in the relationship. sometimes it keeps me up at night. has anyone ever felt something similar? (also: my anxiety+depression is the most manageable it has been in years. i have been taking zoloft for about 2 months now, and i've never felt better. however, i still have a lot of worries about certain things, like my boyfriend's safety for example, that haven't completely gone away. thanks for any advice guys.)",Anxiety

"so if you’re reading this and currently in the midst of an anxiety disorder, let me start by saying i know how you feel. i’ve had panic attacks where the adrenaline rushes just don’t stop, i’ve been nauseated and unable to eat or drink for days on end, i’ve felt so short of breath it was like drowning above water, had the jitters and the lump in my throat. i’ve also had all of the uncomfortable mental symptoms. i’ve dissociated for almost a full day multiple times, i’ve had racing, intrusive thoughts that lasted weeks and sometimes months at a time. and i’ve felt like i was going crazy. a lot. but i’m here to tell you my struggle with my anxiety disorder is over. after almost a year of conscious and concerted effort, all of the worst symptoms of my anxiety are completely gone. some of the more mild ones still appear from time to time; i’ll get fatigued or dizzy/foggy maybe once every few weeks, but this happens so infrequently (and becomes less frequent with each occurrence) that it doesn’t really bug me. i was also on medication (an ssri since day one and a benzo for the first few months) and am in the process of tapering off . so i wanted to write a post about how to get over each stage of your anxiety, mainly because i know i really would have appreciated this kind of guidance when i first sought help in late april of last year. if you want a summary of things you can do regardless of what stage you’re at, scroll to the bottom and check the paragraph in bold. i don’t discuss responses to specific symptoms here, just a general approach. if you’re looking for tactics for specific symptoms, check out the list of books i left in the second section. i think the first one does a particularly good job of addressing every symptom, but you can try the third if you don’t feel it makes enough of a difference. before you read, i want to mention something once so i don’t have to later on. recovery is going to be like a rollercoaster. some days you’ll feel like you made incredible progress, and others you’ll have difficulty even doing simple tasks. it’s going to be a lot of two steps forward, one step back. sometimes it’ll even be two steps forward, two steps back. but even those times are okay, because they serve as proof that you are capable of improving. just know that once you start to give effort, things will start gradually getting better. so here it is. my comprehensive guide to recovering from an anxiety disorder. if you’re at a constant 9/10 - 10/10 anxiety and can’t calm down: at this stage, you’re either in the middle of panic attack (which lasts up to 60 minutes) or you have gad and are constantly anxious. i was diagnosed with gad and pure-o but i’ve had maaaaaany panic attacks, so i know this advice will work for both. **1.** stop trying to fight your anxiety symptoms. understand that the best thing you can do for your body right now is just let it run its course. this is the basis of acceptance and commitment therapy (act) which is one of the types of therapy currently used to treat anxiety disorders. to do this: * don’t try to stop any symptoms you are experiencing. this is infinitely easier said than done at first, but with practice you’ll be able to pick this up fairly quickly. when i was first having constant adrenaline rushes, i kept trying to consciously stop them. this was actually making things worse. the more you try to fight your symptoms, the more worried you become, which in turn causes your system to release more of the stress-causing hormones, causing your symptoms to become worse. the best thing you can do at this point is wait it out and let your body tire itself out. * questions, doubts, and fear will come up. when they do, remind yourself that this is a totally normal process that your body is going through, and try to rest in the anxiety. it may be difficult, but try to ease into the symptoms. this was initially what helped my adrenaline rushes decrease in severity and frequency. * if this isn’t working and you find your symptoms are still persisting and won’t stop, ask for more. as the dare response (discussed later) puts it, run towards your symptoms. if you’ve ever read a book on act, this step is likely in there. when you ask your body to make your symptoms worse, you’ll find it can’t. the symptoms of anxiety are driven by a subconscious worry, and not something you can control. keep running towards it until your symptoms gradually begin to ease, then move on to step 2. in case you’re interested, the clinical term for this is “arousal reappraisal.” it’s not discussed very often, but i found it to be very helpful. **2.** do anything you possibly can to get your mind off of the anxiety. in older forms of anxiety treatment, this kind of thing was referred to as a distraction tactic, but in the dare response, barry mcdonagh calls it being “engaged.” this basically means do whatever you can to focus your mind on something other than your anxiety. regardless of what level of anxiety you’re at, this is incredibly important. **your anxiety is most easily fueled when you focus on it, so do whatever you can to move your attention to something else.** again, much easier said than done, and your mind will fight you at every stage. but it’s an integral part of recovery. when i first started out, i found short activities the most helpful, like picking up my guitar/cajon and playing a song or two, or doing homework. **3.** give it time. your system can’t sustain anxiety levels this high for an extended period of time unless you consciously fuel it. if you are properly easing into your symptoms and engaging yourself in other activities you’ll eventually calm down to the next phase of anxiety recovery. **4.** if recommended by your physician, a benzo might help. benzos are basically nervous system relaxants, but they’re no magic pill. when i took my first dose of valium, i didn’t feel a thing. it took a few days of constant dosing to see any effect. benzos are fine to use in the very beginning, but i will issue a warning about them: try to use them as sparingly as possible. benzos are not meant to be used in the long term, and if the first thing you do when feeling anxious is reach for your benzo, you’ll have real difficulty recovering in the later stages. but since at this point, you’re in a constant state of panic, they’re a great way to ease you down to the next lowest stage of anxiety, so you can start focusing on the long term. **5.** journal. i don’t recommend this as much beyond this stage, as i’ve found it doesn’t really help all that much. but in the beginning stages of my experience with gad, i found journaling to be an indispensable asset to really figure out what i was going through. just write out whatever you’re thinking or feeling. it’s a great what to get out of your head for at least a little bit. **6.** get up and do something to release all your pent up adrenaline. walk around the block, take a stretch break at work. you don’t need to be doing a full workout at this point, just something to help you use the jitters and adrenaline you’re getting for something productive. **7.** this one may seem rather minor, but it helped me a lot in the beginning: fix your posture. it’s much easier to feel short of breath when you’re in a position that doesn’t let you breath easily. if you’re lying down, lay on your back. if you’re sitting, sit up straight. once you’ve thoroughly calmed down from this point (this took me about three or four weeks), you can move on to the next step. constant 6 - 8/10 with occasional panic attacks: if you’re at this phase, you are probably still experiencing physical manifestations of your anxiety, like jitters, nausea, jelly legs, shortness of breath, and so on. but you’re not in constant freakout mode anymore. you can make logical decisions aimed more at long term recovery because rather than being focused on your anxiety 100% of the time, you pay attention to it 80 - 90% of the time. you may be leaving the house occasionally but your symptoms are still bad enough that they keep you at home most of the time. so here’s what to do at this stage: **1. start reading or listening to books on what you’re going through**. the more you understand the subtleties of what’s going on in your brain and body, the better you’ll be able fix them. read up on therapy techniques as they’ll be your quickest route to recovery. in the end, this ended up being the single most helpful thing for my recovery. when you’re knowledgeable of exactly what is at your disposal, you can try everything and see what works best for you. in fact, i found really helpful ideas in books that none of my therapists had even heard of. like your anxiety, the list of books that will be the most helpful for you is very personalized, but here are my recommendations (all of these books are available on audible, which is how i consumed them): * the dare response. phenomenal book written by someone who’s been through the worst parts of anxiety and paved his own path to recovery. his techniques are a combination between act and a little cbt. i would especially recommend this book if you’re at the higher end of the anxiety scale. * feeling good: the new mood therapy. this book is considered the gold standard of cbt. it’s aimed at treating depression, but (as the author notes) it works for anxiety as well. i listened to the whole thing, then picked out the chapters i thought applied to me. it’s long, so i don’t think you need to do the first part, but there’s a lot of valuable information in this book that a lot of other books skim over. * rewire your anxious brain. this one is 1/4 cbt, 1/4 lifestyle guidance, and half about the neuroscience behind anxiety. i like this one a lot because it gets into some of the mechanics of why we feel the way we do, and why therapy and lifestyle changes are so impactful. * the subtle art of not giving a fuck. this one has been mentioned on this subreddit several times before, and i really like it. it serves as a great reminder of why some things in life just aren’t worth giving a fuck about. fair warning: mark manson describes ocd as “an incurable disease” in this book. he’s not a doctor or therapist and isn’t really knowledgeable on the subject, so i’d take that section with a grain of salt. but the message he drives home at the end is really good regardless. remember, the point of these books isn’t to give you step by step instructions on how to get better. rather they are there to give you ideas on how to best help yourself. **2.** get into therapy. this is perhaps the second most important things you can do for yourself behind reading. therapy is the first line of treatment for anxiety, and for good reason. once you find a therapist who you work well with, you’ll notice you progress much more quickly. some things to look out for when you screen your therapist: * are they nice? kind of an obvious one but worth going over. do you feel like they take what you’re saying seriously? are their answers usually thoughtful and caring? * are they experienced? my first therapist was tremendously nice and caring, but he didn’t know much about anxiety treatment beyond the very basics, like square breathing. * are they accessible? or do you have to drive two hours to see them? are they available for weekly sessions or can you only see them once a month? it may take a while until you find a therapist who’s right for you, but this is a person you’ll be meeting with multiple times a month for several months/years. i would advise giving your therapist at least three or four sessions before you consider switching to a new one. **3.** continue with all the acceptance techniques outlined in the previous section. these are things that i remind myself of even now. the more open you are towards your anxiety symptoms, the more quickly they’ll dissipate. in addition, if you can, start easing off your benzo a little bit. if you’re taking it three times a day, try to move down to two. if you’re down to two a day, try one. **4.** start making some lifestyle changes that are proven to help with anxiety in the long term: * cardiovascular exercise. it’s said that exercise is one of the most positive things to improve mood when you’re anxious, but i’d like to look at it from the opposite perspective. when you’re anxious, your body is filled with excess adrenaline that keeps building up. if you don’t dump it out somehow, the symptoms will inevitably get worse. so getting up from your desk or your bed is one of the most effective things you can do to help yourself in the long term. if you’re not super exercise savvy, my suggestion is to get out and walk, jogging occasionally. walking is great for releasing excess energy, but you can boost the speed at which you let off adrenaline by running. you don’t need to do sprints whenever you run, but you’ll get the most out of your exercise if you really challenge yourself each time. more on this later. * meditation. the reason so many people say this is so good for anxiety is because it helps you better come to terms with your symptoms. it also lets you really hone in on some of the less productive thought processes you’re having so you can learn to catch and correct them. keep in mind, the purpose of meditation is not to clear your mind and think of nothing. in fact, it’s almost the opposite. while meditating, your job is to let your body and brain work as normal and merely try to act as a conscious observer of all your thoughts and feelings. a really popular visualization technique for this is thinking of your thoughts as clouds, and you’re just watching them pass by. there is plenty of information out there on how to meditate, and it includes helpful techniques like noting, so i won’t go into it that much here. make sure that your approach to meditation is similar to your approach to exercise: slowly ease into it by doing it for short periods at first, then working up very gradually to longer periods after every couple sessions. i suggest trying out the meditation app calm. * diet. if you’re reading this, you’ve probably read the do’s and don’ts of your diet about a hundred times, but i’ll reiterate quickly here: no caffeine, no alcohol. try your best to avoid excessive sweets and fried foods, and those are shown [1] to worsen your mood in the long term. one of the less known changes you can make to your diet is to include more natural sources of magnesium. it is speculated [2] that magnesium plays a part in anxiety regulation, though the research isn’t entirely there yet. regardless, try to include dark leafy greens like spinach and whole grains like brown rice into your diet to hit this as a staple. you can also take a magnesium supplement (i’ll defer to the dare response for information about it), though again, research is shaky so this alone won’t bring change. * medication. this one will be completely at you/your doctor’s discretion. some people respond well to antidepressants, some don’t. i didn’t feel like they helped me all that much, but you might. note, the purpose of antidepressants isn’t to make you happy or to gradually cure your anxiety. research shows [3] that antidepressants are useful for supplementing long term change in the brain. this is a really important thing to note because it means that antidepressants won’t change anything on their own. only if you give conscious effort will you be able to see positive change. medication only makes it happen more quickly. **5.** give it time. your nervous system doesn’t change overnight. it may need a week or two more before you achieve the results you want. so just keep practicing your therapy techniques and doing everything you know works and push through. once you’ve been at these things for a while, you’ll notice your anxiety start to decrease to the next phase. hovering around 4 - 6: if you’re at this stage, congratulations! the first two stages are really hard to break out of, and if you did, it likely took a tremendous amount of effort. so give yourself a pat on the back. once you’ve reached this stage, your anxiety likely doesn’t manifest itself physically as much. you may still get nauseated occasionally, but most of the time you’re able to eat and drink and (hopefully) sleep through the night. you’ve started reclaiming your normal life. you get out of the house relatively frequently and do things like run errands. but you’re still really anxious whenever you go out. in addition, though your physical symptoms may have eased up, your mental symptoms may still be incredibly difficult to deal with. so here’s what you should do at this stage: **1.** keep staying the course. it’s easy to flounder or stop, and it’s okay if you do. but remember to pick up right where you left off. also, don’t beat yourself up for making mistakes. everyone falters from time to time, it’s part of what makes us human. and it’s okay if things are taking longer than you expected. take it from me that if you keep looking for ways you can improve your anxiety and practicing the techniques you know work, things will get better. **2.** keep pushing the envelope. identify areas of your life that you’ve always been anxious about and challenge yourself to use therapy techniques to improve them. i used to beat myself up for being awkward ever since i was a little kid. i’d find flaws in every interaction i had with others and nitpick every little thing. once i started working on this, i noticed not only an improvement in these kinds of situations, but also an improvement in my overall anxiety. this is part of how exposure and response prevention (erp) therapy works. you expose yourself to situations that make your anxiety flare up, and use cbt techniques to curb your conscious worry. an important note about this is **these experiences aren’t meant to be fun**. if you’ve got social anxiety and you’re challenging yourself by going to meet new people, it’ll likely be an uncomfortable experience the first few times. people around you may be having plenty of fun while you keep worrying and criticizing yourself. but you’ll slowly notice improvement, and with time, it’ll become more and more natural over time. **3.** along the same lines, start making your workouts more difficult. run/bike/swim for longer, lift heavier weights. when you’re anxious, you tend to stagnate in certain areas of your life, sometimes without realizing it. the only way to get better is to keep pushing the bounds of what you do. i saw a post on this subreddit a while ago along the lines of “i’ve been lightly jogging for 25 minutes a day for the last month or two, why aren’t i seeing my anxiety improve?” and the answer in this case is because this person wasn’t pushing him/herself. if you continue to do the same things, you shouldn’t expect to see improvement. **4.** start identifying and cutting off some of your crutches/unhealthy habits. for a lot of us (me included), this comes in the form of googling symptoms or constantly asking for help on this subreddit. it’s okay to cave every once in a while at this stage, but you need to consciously stop yourself from constantly asking for help on the internet. one of the things this does is keep you focused on your anxiety, which is exactly what engaging yourself is meant to prevent. i stopped browsing this subreddit for almost a half year, and my condition got much better as a result. if you’re seriously concerned about something, visit your doctor/psychiatrist/therapist and ask them, but once they diagnose you, do not second guess it. i spent my entire college career going to different doctors (i think at least 10 or 11 different types, sometimes multiple doctors of each kind). i was convinced there was something wrong with me that no one could find, but the true culprit was anxiety. if you **feel** like you’re constantly sick or dying, yet doctors can’t find anything wrong, this is a clue that you have an issue with being a hypochondriac. you can go about fixing this the way you did in all areas of your therapy (i personally used the cbt method outlined in feeling good), but the important thing is to recognize that just because your brain is telling you something doesn’t mean it’s true. **5.** give it time. i’ve said it before but it’s important to reiterate. recovering from this stage might take several months, so try your best to be patient. and remember, if things aren’t the way you want them to be now, they will be soon. i think it’s also important to discuss the idea of **cognitive fusion**, which you may have come across in your book reading, as i think understanding it will be really helpful. google defines cognitive fusion as attaching a thought to an experience, but since that’s kind of vague, i’ll give my own definition. cognitive fusion is when you take what your thoughts tell you as fact. in other words, you’re using your thoughts to draw irrational conclusions about the world around you. one example of this is if you’re someone who criticizes themselves too much. you might tell yourself “that conversation was so awkward, so that person must think i’m a loser.” in this case, whether or not the situation was awkward, you don’t know what the other person is thinking. i used to think this a lot until i realized people really didn’t see me that way, and all the worrying i did was for nothing. a healthy level of questioning can do lots to help you overcome your anxiety. at this stage, i had the most trouble with mental symptoms, namely the feeling of going crazy. i thought the little floaters in my eyes were hallucinations, i always second guessed my own sanity, i thought the weird dreams or intrusive thoughts i was having were a sign of schizophrenia, and anytime i was happy, i thought it was a sign of bipolar disorder. this is another great example of cognitive fusion that took me a while to get over: i thought i was going crazy, so to me that was evidence that i really was. if you think this describes you, it might do you well to get into the habit of questioning your thoughts as well. is it more logical that your psychiatrist, therapists, family, and friends are correct when they say you’re not crazy and are just experiencing symptoms of anxiety, or that you’re the one person out of the fifty who’s somehow figured out you’re losing it? this applies to basically every anxious situation you may encounter. remember: **just because you think something doesn’t make it true**. one of the things that took me a long time to realize was that my constant worry over these things was caused by the fact that i was paying so much attention to them. at this point in recovery, it’s absolutely **imperative that you keep yourself occupied, especially when you’re most anxious**. i found that doing things like cooking and cleaning were ways to keep my mind off my anxiety without having to think about it. i suggest doing the same, as they’re both productive and beneficial in the end. eventually, your mind will calm down on its own and you’ll find your own solutions to these symptoms. i find that at this point the really important thing really is time. once i felt like i was going crazy for the hundredth time, i realized that if every time before this one was a false alarm, this one (and all the ones after for that matter) are false alarms too. this stage took about 3 months to recover from, but once i did, i hit the next stage. anxiety is 1 - 3 most days, with some days feeling almost completely anxiety free: you’re in the home stretch. this is it. you’re likely already giving yourself credit for all the hard work you’ve done, but you should still take a moment to recognize just how far you’ve come. for me, having a day where i go out and try something new with friends while anxious is something i wouldn't have been able to do even before my anxiety disorder. certainly not anything i’d ever dreamed of while in the thick of it. seriously, if you’ve hit this point, the light should be at the end of the tunnel. and on the days where it’s a little harder to deal with, let me reassure you: you’re almost home free. note: your symptoms will still be present at this point. some of the intrusive thoughts might still come, sometimes you’ll have a bit of dissociation or an occasional almost-panic attack, but you know how to deal with these things. your moments of panic don’t last more than a few seconds, and your symptoms don’t really illicit a response from you. at this stage: **1.** you know what works best for you. keep doing it. you have your techniques and you’ve clearly demonstrated they work. all that’s left is to keep doing them and reap the rewards you know will come. on the worse days when your anxiety peaks at a 3 or 4, remind yourself where you were several months ago and how you’ll never experience anxiety that bad ever again. then gently engage yourself in something and ride the wave of anxiety until it subsides. **2.** slowly lose your crutches. if you discuss your anxiety with your friends, stop doing so as frequently and eventually stop altogether. if you’re still occasionally taking benzos, slowly taper off. the more of your independence you get back, the more confident you’ll feel. **3.** keep exploring other areas of your life where you’ve had anxiety and use what you’ve learned to stop worrying. for me, this meant things like conquering my fear of heights by going snowboarding, and confronting my discomfort with physical and emotional intimacy by going out of my way to discuss these things. the more of these long-standing anxieties you’re able to ease, the better you’ll feel overall. plus you get the added sense of achievement for doing things that past you would’ve never been able to do. there really isn’t much left to say at this stage. i found myself being discouraged more frequently at this point just because i knew i was so close to the finish line but not quite there. in case you need any encouragement, remind yourself of how well you’ve done so far and that there’s more to come. then finally… no anxiety, with the worst days peaking at a 0.5 or 1: that’s it. all the voices in your head telling you you’re not good enough have gone silent. all those symptoms you used to worry so much about don’t really happen anymore. you might still be a bit fatigued or foggy some days, but most of the time you’re energetic, present, and can confront new challenges with a sense of confidence you’ve never had. it’s been a few months since you’ve even given your anxiety a second thought. you know some of your symptoms might come back for a short spell every once in a while, but you’re not worried about them. you know exactly what to do when that happens, and that they’ll go away just as quickly as they came. i don’t have any advice for this point. you know what got you here and have built up the mental fortitude to know you’ll keep on doing it. congratulations. you understand how amazing it is that you got to this point. remember this feeling. _ my therapist once gave me a great rule of thumb i think sums things up really well: whatever your anxiety is telling you to do, do the opposite. if it’s telling you not to get out of bed, do it. if it’s telling you not to go to a social event, do that. if it’s telling you you’re going to suffer from some grave illness, remind yourself that’s not true. if it’s telling you to google your symptoms or ask for help, don’t. if it’s telling you you’re losing your mind, remind yourself you’re not. give it enough time, and eventually things will get better. **summary:** **ease into your symptoms. remember that it’s just anxiety and can’t do anything other than make you uncomfortable. you’ve been through this a hundred times before and survived every single time.** **don’t fight it. when you fight your anxiety, it only gets worse. so let your anxiety do whatever it wants and just watch as a detached observer.** **keep yourself occupied. the more time you spend thinking about your anxiety, googling your symptoms, posting on this subreddit, writing in your journal, or just stewing in general, the worse off you’ll be. cook, clean, dance, exercise, paint, draw, do anything you can to forcibly rip your mind off your anxiety.** **keep pushing the bounds of what you’re doing. expose yourself to more anxiety. exercise harder. try things you’ve never tried before. make your anxiety flare up as much as possible because you know it’ll only benefit you in the end.** **regularly question your thoughts. just because you think something doesn’t make it true. you’ll find a hundred times out of a hundred the thing you’ve been dreading isn’t half as horrible as your brain has made it out to be.** **give it time. you’ll find once you experience the same anxiety for the same reason for the thousandth time in a row that it becomes a bit easier to stop believing what it tells you.** thank you for reading

"making friends is something i'm legitimately unable to wrap my head around. even as my social anxiety has lessened, i *cannot* understand how people do it. the only way i've managed to make friends is having people approach me first, and had they not, i would be completely alone. i feel as though i have some developmental disorder because of how socially impaired i am. going up to someone i don't know and talking to them seems impossible to me, unless it's somewhere like a store or restaurant (which i still struggle with from time to time). not knowing how they'll react scares me, and i feel like any attempt i made at conversation with anyone would result in me embarrassing myself and nothing else.",Anxiety
"when i was about 12 (25 years ago), i used to have this group of friends that i would go out to lunch with to restaurants near school on half days. one day at school, i overheard this one guy who was in the same group ask another guy in the group if i was going to lunch that day. the other guy said no, and the first guy said ""good, because raingodofmorning is so annoying."" then he turned around and saw me, and gave some half-hearted, awkward, non-apology. i've never really gotten over this, and i have a fear of hanging out with people and them secretly wishing i wasn't there because i'm so annoying, but me never knowing about it. and i actually think that i might be pretty annoying to be around. my brain works really, really fast and i have anxiety and adhd, so i talk fast and i can talk a lot. i put a ton of effort into not interrupting, but it's very hard to listen without getting distracted by random thoughts. (i know that everyone does this, and try to remind myself most people aren't paying attention to everything i say, but i feel like an extreme case of this). i have trouble in awkward silences with coworkers not filling the silence, like i never know when to leave someone's office or how to stop talking when someone is in my office--even if i want the person to leave. i don't talk to anyone outside of work except for some out of town friends via text (i type too much there, too). i had some friends i used to hang out with at these gatherings where they'd host people at their house weekly, and i stopped hanging out with them suddenly. i saw them recently when they came by to pick up something from me, and it was a pretty awkward encounter, and they didn't say anything like ""we miss you at the gatherings"" or ""why don't you come anymore?,"" or ""you should come next week,"" or anything, really, outside of a vague ""we should get dinner sometime"" that sounded like the clichéd thing people say when parting, regardless of whether they mean it. this is something i've identified as an external clue (as in, not something from my own head) that they might also find me annoying. i'm not quite sure if i should work on: (a) just accepting that i am an annoying person and being okay with keeping my contact with others limited in order to avoid inadvertently thrusting myself upon a social group one too many times, or (b) if i should work on convincing myself that i'm not annoying, even if it isn't really true.

"you know how there is often this sense of fear at the back of your mind? that no matter how well things are going, there is a small voice that says: ""watch out, bad things are happening! never let your guard down!"" that voice is what kept our ancestors alive. our brains have a preprogrammed tendency to pay attention to the negative, to danger and trouble, and that is in part what fuels our anxiety. the good news is that underneath our experience there is also an underlying sense of ok-ness, alrightness. while you may be stressed out or upset, there is a foundation of awareness that runs deeper than any temporary fear, like a quiet sea bed hundred feet below a howling storm. in fact, take a close look at this moment, right now. you are probably alright: no one is attacking you, you are not falling or drowning, there is no immediate crisis. your experience might be far from perfect, and it might include unpleasant thoughts or emotions, but right this moment at least, you are basically okay. there are of course times when you are not okay. sometimes you are in real danger, your body is hurting, someone is mistreating you or your mind is in full panic mode. but i bet that during any given day, you can find a half a dozen or a dozen moments where you can honestly say, ""yeah, right now i'm okay"". notice and savor those experiences! you are not trying to convince yourself of anything or trying to cover of your suffering under a thin varnish of ""positive thinking"". you are simply becoming aware of the fact that you are not under threat, in danger or harmed. experiencing this over time, again and again, will gradually change your brain an help you become calmer and stronger. *adapted from rick hanson's just one thing.*",Anxiety

"my wife passed out from a panic attack yesterday in the theatre while we were watching *a quiet place*. i was so scared and didn't know what to do. about an hour into the movie, there's a scene where someone steps on a nail. it wasn't even very gory, but i guess it triggered some bad memories for her. a few seconds after that scene, my wife's arm started twitching kind of like a seizure. at the same time, she started making sounds like she was snoring or maybe choking. when i looked at her, her head was lolled to the side and her eyes were closed. not realizing what was happening, i nudged her a bit, thinking she had fallen asleep. when her head rolled to the other side and there wasn't any other response my concern sky-rocketed. i took her head in my hands and gently shook her a little bit trying to wake her up. her eyes partially opened, and i could see her pupils were looking up like when you roll your eyes. there was no other response. i tilted her head forward and the ""snoring"" sound stopped, but she was still unconscious. at this point, about half a minute or so had passed with her in this state and i thought i had a real medical emergency on my hands. there were only two other people in the theatre with us, and they were a couple rows ahead of us. they glanced back when i started to loudly say, *""are you okay?! honey, are you all right?""* i was about to call 911. with her head in my hands, i placed my mouth against her ear and yelled, *""can you hear me?! honey!?!""* suddenly, there was signs cognition. her eyes opened, and she started breathing very quickly. i'd estimate she was out for about a minute. she glanced around like she was trying to figure out where she was at, and finally seemed to see and recognize me. in between gasps for breath she managed to say, *""i'm having a panic attack.""* up to that point i didn't know what was going on. i was so scared. *""come on, let's go.""* i said. i put my arm under hers and held her tightly as we descended the stairs. she wasn't steady on her feet, and was leaning on me quite a bit. when we finally got out of the theatre she collapsed down on the floor against the wall and kind of rocked a little bit back and forth. *""i... can't... take... visceral horror.""* she said. i just held her; trying to comfort her. after a couple minutes she said she felt well enough to walk, so we walked back to our car. she said she didn't need to go to the hospital. we only live about 5 minutes from the theatre. after we made it home, she said she just needed me to hold her and help her feel safe. i tried to just hold her and comfort her. after about a half hour she was doing better. i felt so helpless when she was unconscious. it's very scary when you suddenly realize your loved one is having a medical emergency. later in the evening, she revealed to me that when she was a teenager, she had an abusive boyfriend that would rape her, cut her with a scalpel, and poke her with needles. sick stuff like that i guess. she wouldn't say much more about it than that. i am angry. not at her, but at the thought some sicko did this to her. and i hurt. i grieve that she has experienced something so traumatic it causes this type of thing. she agreed we will get her into some therapy. she needs healing that i never knew she needed. i also know this isn't about me, but i feel a bit hurt this is just now coming out. we've been married about 5 years, and i never knew this stuff. what else don't i know? i don't know what type of advice i'm looking for. how can i be there for her? how can i help? what do i do if this happens again? did i do the right thing both during and after?",Anxiety

"i have what i would call mild social anxiety. basically i'm shy but it really doesn't bother me much. what bothers me is my lack of success with girls. even thinking about it makes me anxious. thinking about the last girl i liked (who is now in a relationship) basically puts me into a panic attack, heart racing, hot face, almost in tears, can't do anything. seeing couples or hearing about them also makes me very anxious. going on things like tinder or facebook to try and get girls makes me really anxious as well. the problem is that this anxiety is so overwhelming that i don't even go on facebook or tinder anymore. it literally ruins my day if i do. but the more i don't socialise the worse this anxiety gets. i feel like i'm in an ever increasing hole. i'm 23 and never had a girlfriend so this might explain why i'm like this. but i don't know what to do to alleviate this. i don't tell anyone about it as it's so pathetic. i don't have a hard life and have no justification to feel this way, but i do. after going on facebook this morning i've been feeling terrible all day. i don't even know why i'm posting this, i just don't know where to go from here.",Anxiety
"a stigma that i’ve noticed in the mental health community... so many people are happy to talk about it and embrace your differences, but oh no.. don’t have a panic attack in front of them, don’t seek re-assurance from today’s anxious thoughts and jitters. this is something that needs changing. it is more than ok for someone with diabetes to be comforted even when they deliberately let their blood sugar go too low, and then be looked after by people around them. (this was one of my co-workers) but when i struggled with low mood i was told ‘we all have days like that’ ... ‘don’t let customers see you unhappy or uncomfortable’ this is an issue with how subjective everyday anxiety and a chronic mental health issue is, if someone does not understand the effort it takes to behave normally they will default to judging you based on how they deal with it. of course it’s not all bad, i’m lucky to have family and a handful of friends that have seen me go though treatments and recovery so know the full spectrum of my issues and do not judge or baby me. i felt like sharing this little rant to hear your thoughts on if you’ve been accepted or told to ‘hide’ symptoms from the public to spare their discomfort... like your doing it on purpose.",Anxiety

"i just got my results back from my covid swabs.. and they were negative. now let’s go back a week, i couldn’t breathe , i couldn’t take deep breaths and i was coughing. i figured it’s just a cold.. back to my phone. things got worse. i got chills and aches and my breathing was getting more difficult. hmm maybe the flu? back to my phone. still couldn’t breathe , now sweating and coughing harder. hearts racing and on the floor scared and crying because breathing becoming impossible. i went and had a hot bath, drank hot tea , then went to bed .. where i had the worst night of my life . i couldn’t sleep... i was up for 72 hours exhausted in cold sweats with breathing troubles . i finally called the nurses line and told them i was afraid i had coronavirus. we talked and they said to get to the hospital if i got worse , but to phone beforehand so they could prepare for me. my heart sunk and my symptoms got worse. i cried as my kids slept, positive this was the end... i didn’t want to kiss them and infect them, i kept leaving the room and taking deep breaths so i wouldn’t drop dead. i texted my family that i loved them and was sorry for everything i had ever done. i finally passed out , then woke up and immediately ran to the bathroom where i threw up . i hadn’t eaten in 2 days and still puked my guts out. chest still hurt, still having cold sweats and still coughing .. and now nauseated with a bad stomach. maybe i won’t even make it to the hospital. i watched a cnn video of one of their reporters who was sick with covid. he showed some breathing exercises and said to put your arms around your head and to hold it there . i kept doing that over and over and felt better each time. didn’t feel like i was dying as bad as a few nights before . however each time i read the news my symptoms got worse and my panicking was like nothing i’ve experienced before .. i took some medicine and i cried myself to sleep. i finally slept.. briefly . i then woke up and had a bunch of mucus come up my throat and i began choking on it .. it wouldn’t stop coming up and my chest pains started up. they called me and my covid test was scheduled for the next day. i took some mucus cold medicine which seemed to help as i slept for the first time since this hell started.. and i woke up feeling good. no coughing .. no cold sweats... no puking. chest was still tight but i slept and that’s just what i needed. my test was at 1 and i was nervous , i pulled up and everyone was covered and masked up and i felt so alone. they asked about my symptoms as well as if i had depression or anxiety... both of which i do. they checked my temperature, my blood pressure, my throat and swabbed my throat and both nostrils. i said i didn’t sleep much and i was spending about 13 hours a day on the news.. mainly watching new york city and italy. the doctor stopped by and said do not.. watch any news outside of where you live (our province) she said “watch/read only your province news as everything else will only make your anxiety worse than ever.. just focus on keeping yourself and everyone around you safe. keep washing your hands frequently and stay indoors and away from others.. and that includes your grandma” she is my grandmas doctor and knows how close we were. i went home and cleaned and for the first time .. stayed off international news. that was a few days ago and i have yet to go back on any... and i haven’t had a single anxiety attack since. all my symptoms besides chest pain went away... when i start to think about it again (like right now) they come back a bit .. so i’ll turn a movie on and they go away. so when i got my results i just thought wow anxiety is one of the scariest things... i truly thought i was going to die. i know there’s a lot of scary horrible things going around our world right now , and i hope it is over soon, but watching the news 24/7 isn’t going to help anything especially if you are mentally ill like me. the best thing we can do, is stay busy and stay safe and stay off the international news . i just wanted to post this incase anyone was like me browsing here wondering if you have anxiety or if it’s covid... anxiety is a true evil and will make you think you have whatever it is you’re scared of. deep breaths and put your focus elsewhere.. like a meditation app. thinking of you all. sorry i typed this on my iphone and have no clue how to format properly.",Anxiety

(rationally i can see she's not acting like a sick cat, you can tell when they're uncomfortable and have given up. plus the vet hasn't done or said anything that seems like they think she's that sick. it's just my scared little mind that won't shut up and stop crying) it's like anything (in general, not just currently with the cat), but any time something isn't perfect, it's the end of the world and i'm positive it'll never get better. so i seem to spend a lot of time worrying about how i'm gonna handle the worst-case scenario which my mind won't stop telling me is definite even though the rational whisper knows i've never yet had to deal with the worst-case scenarios. i'm just wondering if y'all can relate? is this an anxiety/panic related thing? i've got some other issues (diagnosed bipolar and self-suspected mild asperger's) so i'm trying to define/understand what's going on with this catastrophe thinking because i deal with my issues/symptoms best when i understand better where they stem from.",Anxiety
"whenever i'm awake for too long, i get anxiety, even though i have nothing to feel anxious about. like,if i need to stay awake for studying or work in, or, for example,let's say i stayed up all night, and then i want to stay awake during the day to fix my internal clock; (so i won't sleep during the day and stay awake during night again) i get strong anxiety and then i end up needing to sleep before planned. when i force myself to go through it, i end up feeling incredibly unwell (nauseous, low pressure, tachycardia) once or twice before i start having full-on panic attacks. then the crisis keeps going and i have to wait until they pause so i, again against my plans, can go to sleep. it seems there's no way out. i hate this and i wish i could push my body when needed like a normal person. this always happens when i push myself to stay awake and is really annoying, and also, other people don't understand or trust me and end up seeing me as just undisciplined and unable to have self control (just sleeping because i give in too easily or idk). tl;dr: post title",Anxiety
"my doctor and counselor have me listed as extreme anxiety and depression, early childhood ptsd, bi polar, borderline personality disorder. it's a relief to have an answer to what my problems are. this has been an on going problem my whole adult life. my first job, i had reasons for being depressed. i dropped out of school, parents were divorcing and i didn't have a stable housing situation, i was falling behind and depressed, full of anger and anxiety. i didn't want to call myself weak though and admit i had a problem, so i attempted to self medicate by escaping reality. i skateboarded, played video games, drank, smoked weed, partied, did everything i could to feel numb. 5 years later, because i didn't seek help or medication early on, i was put on suicide watch due to my new medications not working properly. i have had a girlfriend for 4 years now, i just play games now and skate, no negative influences in my life. none the less, last month i lost my job, where both my girlfriend and i worked together, and commuted together for 2 hours everyday. we both made pretty decent incomes, my girlfriend is my back bone and structure to things getting better in my life. i can't thank her enough despite me losing my job and making the workplace awkward for her. she helped me apply for disability. she helped me stay in contact with my advocate for whatever questions needed to be answered. we filled out the questionnaire's together and made the best of a shitty situation, we have savings to go off of, luckily we live with her father in a nice location in california rent free, we cover utilities and our phone bill/internet and that's it. well, has and groceries as well, we just do our best on her one income until my sdi gets submitted and approved. i'm currently seeking my residency and gathering needed paperwork for the drivers written test, then i can finish my sdi application. my point to all this is i would be homeless and probably dead without her. she has saved my ass countless times over the years,having a mental illness makes holding a job so fucking difficult, i've lost at least 6 jobs since being with her. i have nothing but respect and love for her to be putting up with all this, while we are both still fairly young (i'm 24, she's 21 later this year) i wish her parents understood mental illness, but it's kind of a taboo in her family so we keep things as vague as possible. i just hope that i get through to disability services and can make an income that way, to relieve some stress from her life. she put off school for me from the very beginning, the least i can do is help her get through school. sorry about the rant. i hope everyone has a great day.",Anxiety

"tomorrow i bury my best friend who tragically passed away at the age of 25. i'm heartbroken and i will be speaking at his funeral. i am happy with the speech but i am nervous, petrified to mess up. he was an incredible guy and i want to send him off well, justify what he meant to me. my ex who broke up with me 2 months ago has kept contact to ask how i have been doing and if i ever needed anything go to her. i went to the gym yesterday evening just to pass the time and maybe work off a small hangover i was nursing from the night before. i felt okay but by the end of my session i was very tired. as i was walking back towards my flat i spot my ex with a guy next to her sitting down. i could have turned around but i didn't. i go up to her and say hi, she seems shocked to see me and asks if i'm doing okay. i say no, not really and say i'll leave them to it and say goodbye. as i walk down the road my ex has caught up with me after she runs to catch up with me. she says she has done this to tell me that what's happening with her and him is not what it seems and she didn't want me to worry about something when it's not. she says they are not seeing each other and that he is just a work friend. that he is going through a hard time. we then get talking about how i'm feeling, how devestated i am, how i'm scared for wednesday. she and a mutual friend went to a concert last week and she mentions they talked. she said she went on a rant about how much she cares about me, that i was her best friend, that she is worried for me. she says she's nearly messaged me just to see if i want to hang out. she has come to me since my best friends death to apologise and she says that she will leave me alone now and will wait for me to message. i do say i miss her but right now my head is all over the place. i'm considering my options about going home and starting again. that i'm not looking for anyone right now. i'm just tired, exhausted. she said i look like i haven't eaten well, that i'm really pale. she nearly went to the same club as me the night before but didn't and stays she's glad she didn't. she offers to cook me a meal or go for coffee. that she is always here for me. i ask again about them and she says they're not seeing other, that something could happen but it isn't. i accidentally saw her open diary just before the break up about a guy who has a family that makes her laugh, feel alive. this guy has a child. i recognise him from her xmas party. i'm really confused about why she chased after me. it's obvious she cares but is she feeling guilty, trying to spare my feelings in the hardest time of my life. i do want her back in my life but seeing her with another guy hurt big time. seeing them close to each other eating ice cream. she works with him, did she like him when we were dating. i also hate the idea of her sharing her sympathy and support with other people, especially a guy like that. and it hurts to hear her say to me he's going through a hard time. i'm going through the hardest time of my life. i feel like i can't use her as a crutch. i'm so confused, hurt, a mess. i bury my best friend tomorrow . i am absolutely terrified. i feel sick, like i'm going to mess up and ruin everything. the last 2 months has been the worst of my life, it just has. i want things to be better. i want him back. i want her back. i feel terrible.",Anxiety

"i might not be able to help everyone but hopefully one person. i'm in no way an expert and i'm still trying to master the following method. it's all about mindfulness/awareness/living in the moment, that's the answer. why do we get anxious at times? because of our thoughts - thoughts that only exists in our mind. it's almost impossible to be anxious while you're living in the moment without thinking about the past or the future. each time you catch yourself thinking/daydreaming just be aware of it and go back to the present and you'll see what a huge difference this makes. i'm not keeping my mind busy to forget about things, i'm doing my best to keep my mind quiet. at night before i go to sleep, i focus on nothing and i have been sleeping a lot better and i am no longer dealing with morning anxiety, why? because i am not focusing on any thought, i'm letting thoughts come and go. this is seriously as easy as it sounds, try it. for a few hours just let thoughts come and go and just be ""aware"" of that precise moment. before when i used to practice this i always gave up because i thought i was supposed to not think of anything but the key is to just be aware that you're thinking, control the thoughts, don't allow them to control you.",Anxiety

"i’ve had various forms of anxiety for years, but it’s my anxiety surrounding work that’s giving me the hardest time. i currently work from home as a freelancer (not by choice), and it’s getting harder and harder to keep things in perspective. i get irrationally worried that i’ve made a mistake, and when i do make the inevitable mistake, it feels as if my entire world is falling apart. like i’ve failed in the one thing i still have in my life, and am therefore undeserving of life. outwardly, i can accept criticism gracefully, but on the inside i’m a screaming disaster. i can deal with those feelings. it’s awful and makes me want to vomit until i die, but i’ve somehow managed for years. what’s giving me problems now is what i call “hiding.” i’ve become so afraid of these feelings that i’ve started avoiding working by default. i don’t open emails that have the slightest possibility of criticism. i put off sending emails that might lead to more work. i’ve started avoiding social media because i might see criticism of my work (even though that has literally never happened, and rationally i know it won’t). and with no boss or co-workers to check in on me, i don’t have any impetus to snap out of it. this self-isolation is bad for my mental health (i live alone and have little enough interaction with other humans as it is), and it’s incredibly damaging to my work life. i need advice on how to stop. i’m planning on seeing a therapist as soon as i can afford it—but if i can’t snap out of it first, i won’t ever be able to afford it. has anybody else experienced this? what did/do you do to help?",Anxiety

"around 4 years ago, i went through the worst anxiety i have ever been through. i didn't understand what was wrong with me and thought i was dying. i couldn't be left alone or go outside without going through a panic attack. i would convince myself that every lump i felt was cancerous and make numerous visits to the hospital only for them to send me home after hours of waiting. i was prescribed diazepam/beta blockers and almost prescribed citalopram but i only choose to take 2 diazepam and that was it. during this time i told my mum that i wanted to be sectioned because i believed that i wasn't in control of myself and was unaware that it was my anxiety causing me to think this way. every appointment i attended was also through the help of my mum as i felt like i couldn't go to any of them alone. i received two visits by mental-health specialists, 1 of them believed i should be on medication for life and that i would need to take medication to function and do normal things. the other told me that i should prove him wrong. as time went on i began counselling and attended a group cbt class. at first i felt like nothing had changed and that i had wasted my time but looking back on it now, i feel like everything got put into perspective around that time when i realised that my anxiety is just a part of me and that no matter what discomfort i go through it always ends up going away, i chose to feel the anxiety and not let it affect me doing anything i wanted to do. within the past 2 and a half years i have attended job interviews, bank/doctor appointments and completed a mathematics course. i now do my own food shopping, have a part-time job which is a customer-facing role and i'm in the process of working with a job agency to get a better job. to cut a long story short, i have went from having severe agoraphobia and panic attacks (-4 years ago) to working a part-time job and doing everything for myself. i'll probably delete this post in few hours but i hope it helps somebody on here who feels like their life will never change. i'm also open to any questions, if there are any.",Anxiety
"okay so let me expand a bit on what i'm meaning. basically i go through stages, where i am gripped by my anxiety, where i feel like i need to embody how other people are. by that, i mean i feel like i need to keep changing who i am in order for people to like me. for example, i recently watched a short video on fb taken from a british reality tv show. in it this girl didn't drink alcohol due to personal reasons, so this lead me down a mini anxiety trip of feeling like if i didn't drink people would think i was different and like me. i know this sounds absolutely absurd and it's so wrong to be thinking like that, but i have this constant need to be liked by everyone &amp; i'm also worried that i'll never find who i really am as a person. this then leads me down a whole other path of anxiety riddled thoughts and i end up putting myself in such a hole that i become so unproductive and i hate myself for it. i'm so tired, i want to achieve something in life but i'm literally doing nothing with my life and when i see other people doing stuff, it's like, i should be more like them. i should be motivated and i should be who they are so people like me and make people proud of me. sorry for this vent, i feel like i've gone off on a bit of a tangent at the end there, but i have no one to talk to about these feelings &amp; i wanted to know if it's a common thing or not.",Anxiety

"hey everyone, since quitting weed 1.5 years ago due to the worst (and first) panic attack of my life, i have been experiencing extreme anxiety and panic attacks. i experienced the weirdest and most horrible symptoms including convulsions, nausea, butterflies in stomach, thoughts of death, ectopic heart beats, rolling panic attacks lasting hours/days, itchy skin, pain during urination, sever depression, feeling like i can’t breathe, feeling like i am going to die, insomnia, depersonalisation, derealisation, pains in chest, neck, head, weakness in legs, crazy head pressure where the only way i could sleep was on my stomach because i couldn’t relax my head on my pillow, and face rash, among others. it slowly started getting better last year and then one day it got way worse, and kept getting worse. so then i went to a doctor and got a full checkup because i thought i was dying (anxiety). everything came back normal (except the ectopic heart beats (but they are not dangerous) so then i asked for a referral to see a psych (after she offered me drugs and i said no). started seeing my psych over the course of the last 3 months and over that time i slowly got better until today i realised i have been anxiety free for the last 6 weeks. i also read this book which helped a lot, it’s called rewiring your anxious brain. these two things along with changing jobs from one i hated to one i love has in my opinion cured my anxiety. i am turning 27 this year and the last 1.5 years of my life were the absolute worst years of my life. i am finally loving life again and am so happy that the panic attacks have disappeared and that i am not constantly thinking i am dying. hope this helps anyone who is in a similar situation that i was.",Anxiety

"it's always been something i have feared but it's got so much worse since developing anxiety. i think it stems down to the fact i had a tooth removed when i was only 5. doesn't sound like a big deal but my mum didn't tell me i had to have it removed till the actual day. she just woke me up and got me in the car and told me we were going to the hospital (the children's dentist was at the hospital) so they could put me asleep and remove my tooth. obviously at 5 that seemed pretty scary, didn't help that i had to wait 3 hours when i got there. then again at 7 i had another tooth taken out and it hurt so much i couldn't eat but when i got back to school the teacher forced me too. so now i hate the dentist i have this fear they will end up pulling all my teeth out, which i know is stupid but i can't help it. i'm 17 and havnt been since i was about 9, i desperately need to go because depression and anxiety resulted in me not brushing my teeth often enough and now they look terrible and i also need and would like braces. my main worry is one tooth which has a hole in it and the hole is turning black (tooth decay i'm guessing) i terrified they will just pull it out. anxiety is really making all my fears worse and not to mention the thought of going into the office and lying down while someone prods around in my mouth, i have severe social anxiety so many situations like dentist and doctors appointments make me nervous enough as it is. i don't know what to do i'm going to ask my mum to book an appointment but i won't be able to stop panicking till it's all sorted.",Anxiety

"i wrote a reply to someone elsewhere about my anxiety -- and it made me think about finally speaking about it more publicly. perhaps some people can benefit from my long, embarrassing, terrifying journey. the pictures in this post merely represent improvement over time, although the video would help a lot more, i am not sure if i should publish them or not, at least yet. my journey with anxiety still continues after five years, but at varying points i have had improvements. i lost a job as a result of anxiety, and gradually anxiety took over my life, ending up pure agoraphobic. i did not leave my house for 3 months, and then a few months later i agreed to take fluoxetine (prozac). i started at a mere 1mg because i believed that the medication would make me worse, and result in my death. gradually i rose it over a few weeks until i [finally took my first full to be honest, it gave me headaches but i did sometimes get a feeling of different peace. but then i would often feel quite hyperactive. i started walking to places again, but was probably still using a lot of alcohol at the time. at certain times i would also use propranolol but was convinced it would also kill me. one day i managed to have dental work done, but they gave me 2 diazepam (10mg). the feeling from those finally gave me a feeling of freedom for the first time. i was no longer inside the zone of anxiety. a couple of months past by, and i started acquiring it. eventually i was taking about 10-15mg/day, and the doctors wanted me off it, so i decided to taper. eventually i was off that and onto pregabalin, as it helped the side effects. pregabalin definitely helped me and was the first medication i liked besides the previous diazepam. i have also taken citalopram and hated it, and flipped out and went on an 8 hour bike ride hoping it would come out of my system. although i have had similar thoughts before. sometimes i would freak out and think maybe if i slit my wrists i could bleed out a chemical or something. i guess that is why i was eventually put on something called early intervention for psychosis. **i didn't leave my town for 4 years.** i used a lot of alcohol. i had incidents were i passed out and the usual stuff, and i believed that ultimately, i was going to die. i had nightmares daily about dying in plane crashes. there mere noise of a bus began to eat away at me. i believed that death would be an option, however i never truly acted upon it with intention. i decided to take sertraline at the recommendation of multiple doctors, and all i can say with regards to that is it did help me a bit. gradually i started walking further. but to be honest, i have become very apathetic on it and feel it is time to stop. not to mention it gives me slight diarrhea sometimes. no headaches though. interestingly once i started sertraline, i started therapy, and had a worker within the nhs that drove me to see the sea.

[i caught a bus for the first time and went ...maybe 1/4 of a but that was a success also. i'm a bit more stable these days, however i have relapsed on benzos. at the end of the day benzos are *fucking effective*. they are the gold standard for anxiety. the problem i have right now is i probably should taper but tbh i do not see the point right now -- as i am presently on sertraline still, including ~30-40mg propranolol, ~400mg pregabalin and 10-30mg diazepam. i eventually overcame my fear of propranolol and it actually proved fairly useful. infact in some cases it is more useful than a benzo... sort of. today i am slightly more stable imo, and propranolol and diazepam and pregabalin maintain stability for now. i'd like to try and just decrease all of the drugs in my system. although some people take way more than me :) recently i finally had the courage to travel in a car to other places.

"i don’t know if this has been posted on this thread or not but i figured it could help anyone. over the past six months, i have entered this state of health anxiety where i could get countless tests proving against my theory that i have contracted an illness and still worry afterwards that it was incorrect. she taught me about “scheduling worry time”. for example, i have to figure out a time that i can use during the day (she said go for about an hour) and set a timer. during that time and only during that time am i allowed to let my worry spin into a spiral (sounds counter interactive, right?).. however, what you find with using this method is that often times when you are ignoring or distracting yourself from these worried thoughts before the “worry time” is over with, you tend to forget what you had to worry about.. and it helps you keep from worrying at least for most of the day. i hope this helps any one and give it a try if you feel comfortable!",Anxiety
"i first called my future boss today, (anxiety for calling him). we decided we was gonna drive to the office in the city and talk (the city is 20min away), so i asked my grandma to drive me there. that’s anxiety number 2, being seen with my grandma. i then decided i was gonna go to a store in the city and buy some stuff. this is anxiety trigger number 3. go where it’s a lot of ppl. we went to the office first. he said i can start next week! i even meet my little brothers friends big brother there, cause he was buying something there. the boss even showed me the workspace and his partners and i said hi and talked like i don’t have anxiety / social anxiety at all. i didn’t think “omg what do they think of me etc” nothing like that happened! then we went to the store to buy cloths and some stuff, i went there i talked like normal, i answered hi when the ppl that work there said hi. i looked at them even! then we couldn’t find my cloths really, so we asked a guy that work there. he said follow me and i went away from my grandma cause she went the other way! so now i’m alone with a stranger! i talked to him like normal, i got what i wanted then i said “thank you!” then i calmly walked back to my grandma! then i was gonna try my new bank card. i never used that in a store before and i had huge anxiety that it won’t work when a lot of ppl watching me. so we go to the thingy where u pay, i lay everything up and it didn’t work the first time cause i didn’t push the card all the way in. i even said “hm it doesn’t work” then he said what to do. i did it and i payed then i stood still like so calmly and un anxious while i was looking at my grandma paying when it was like 10 other ppl in the line. it wasn’t a lot of ppl in that store it was no sounds really cause it was only a few ppl there, so maybe i woulda got a lot more anxious if it was more sound/ more ppl but wow i just did this! dijgkwofjskfkdjfjd im so proud of myself! like how on earth did i not feel any anxiety, when normally my anxiety/ social anxiety is god awful! is it cause it’s summer or what?! i just had to share this to someone!!! happy boy.

""why don't you feel good enough? i love you, why isn't that enough? i compliment you all the time. why don't you listen? does my opinion not matter enough?"" it's not that it's not enough. it's that i reject the way you see me because i'm not worth it *in my eyes.* it has nothing to do with what you feel about me, it's just the way i view myself because i've viewed myself negatively for so long, and can't change now. it's too much of a comfort to dislike myself. is that annoying to handle? probably. but, it doesn't change the fact that i can love someone with my whole heart and not feel an ounce of love for myself. can anyone else relate?",Depression
"no special occasion. i just had a tough day at work so i picked up a big bunch of tulips on the way home. not the cheap ones either, but the lovely fresh perfectly blooming crisp and colorful kind. ""what's the big deal?"" you're probably thinking. the big deal is that there was a time in the not so distant past that the thought of ""treating myself"" to anything ""just because"" filled me with guilt, shame and self loathing. you don't deserve it. it's too good for you. you're not worth the time/effort/money. you are nothing and you have nothing to offer so you deserve nothing in return. so now i really appreciate any small act of kindness i afford myself. yes, there are still days that i force myself to have a cold shower in the morning just because i hate it. i love cooking delicious food for other people, but i still sometimes eat instant noodles when i'm alone and having a bad day because it's a waste of time to cook just for me. but today i showed myself a little kindness. i acknowledged the fact that i work damn hard and i am great at my job. i have value and i am valued. tulips are beautiful and so am i. i deserve to have beautiful things in my life because i am a badass bitch.",Depression
"the most popular girl in our entire school here goes around bragging that she's depressed, cuts herself, and wants to die. she doesn't realize that the people who are depressed don't want to scream it to the world. she also says that she's the only person who's actually depressed, her life sucks (her family is rich and loves her), she has no friends, and everyone else who thinks they're depressed is not as miserable as she is. (also, i'm pretty sure she doesn't sh based on the fact that she wears the most revealing outfits possible. the only areas she hasn't shown are the ones that don't show when you wear a bikini.) she says she hates herself while trumpeting how awesome she is because all her teachers like her and she aced that test and she's not fat, et cetera. just needed to vent about this. edit: i tried to talk to her about it and help her, maybe share some of my own experiences. yeah, bad idea. also, she doesn't just tell people, ""hey, i'm depressed"". she makes jokes about people who want to die. not her, other people. like me.",Depression
"i feel pretty good right now, guys. just a little bit of info, i've been self harming since i was 10. for 7 years i've never worn short sleeves outside because i was afraid that someone would find out or judge me because of it. today, i'm finally ending this cycle of self harm. i've kept myself clean and resisted urges for 2 years, waiting for the day i could finally replace the scars with something i love: books. specifically, a literary tattoo! here's a comparison photo (warning: may be triggering, contains scar photos): it's only half done, but i felt like sharing anyway! the lightbulb is inspired by anthem by ayn rand, the moth by the death of the moth by virginia woolf, and some nice green roses to represent oscar wilde. all represents individuality, finality, and pride in being ""different"". these works and people kept me alive through the years. thanks for listening. i don't post often, only when i feel really, really bad. this time i'm glad to be posting something good. :) edit: here's a proper look at the tattoo:",Depression

"i don't see it being discussed much. it makes me feel rather isolated. i don't think i even remember joy. i only seem to recall fear and deep sadness. i've been depressed since i was 9. i suppose i was genetically predisposed to it as it runs on both sides of the family. a lengthy move across the pond, and the bullying that went with being the new, weird kid at school triggered it. an inferiority complex due to a learning disability only made it spiral uncontrollably. most people my age (i'm turning 18 next month) seem to be so excited about life, but i only feel helpless. i am exhausted at this point in life, and feel like i can barely keep up with the ever so busy and growing world. depression has taken all interests and motivation away from me. i have a rather vapid life with a personality to match. i'd be open to read your experiences and feelings!",Depression

"word to the wise, if you want to commit suicide don't call anyone for help. they send a fucking ambulance, force you into it by strapping you down, send you to a mental hospital for mandatory 72-90 hours (weekends don't count), drug you up until your delusional and then bill you for the whole damn thing so you're broke and suicidal again. next time i have a gun to my head i'm pulling the trigger, calling for ""help"" makes everything worse.",Depression

"don’t get me wrong , i’m very grateful that i can take care of myself , but i’m still depressed so i think i get at least some leeway to be pissed about this . what i hate is that when you’re high functioning you don’t have an illness to fall back on . it’s like when arthur fleck says “the worst part about having a mental illness is people expect you to behave as if you don’t” . that’s extremely true in all cases but that’s how i feel right now as a high functioning . when you’re not high functioning people see that you’re not okay and the cut you some slack sometimes , but when you’re high functioning and nobody knows everything is on you . for a while i was vegan but recently transitioned to vegetarian because for a time period i wasn’t eating . i’m sure you guys know how depression makes you not feel like going to eat ... you’re hungry but don’t feel like eating . so for roughly a week i was eating almost nothing but skinny pop and if not i was eating once a day because that was the only vegan thing i didnt have to cook in my house . so someone at school asked why i’d switched my diet so i told them “so and so started telling people i was starving myself” so my cousin goes “you wouldn’t believe it omg if you heard how so and so said it ! she said it like she (me) was depressed!” and that’s the thing . i’ve been depressed for the last four years , but i’m high functioning so is it really valid ? when you don’t feel like cleaning or doing your laundry you’re dirty . when you can’t bring yourself to pick up after yourself you’re dirty . and why’s that ? because nothing is wrong with you and there’s no reason for you to be doing this . they don’t understand depression and it shows . it’s just annoying when you have to be normal like everyone else even though you constantly struggle and nobody sees that . it’s like if it isn’t tangible it just isn’t true !",Depression
"anyone else fantasize about this? this thought has become extremely dominant in my mind lately. i would love to see how ""friends"" and family react to my death. as dark as it sounds i can't help but feel curious. just a day or two of mourning and then back to normal. forgotten. just like how people forget i still exist now.",Depression
"for the first time in a long career of being a depressed human being, i was told ""it gets better"" un-ironically during an otherwise constructive conversation. it made my face flush and i immediately had the urge to end the conversation. so i did. and now i feel like an ass. the phrase ""it gets better"" doesn't seem terrible at face value. i mean, it really isn't terrible. but i feel as though in past years, at least in the us, there has been a rather prolific ad/psa campaign based around the phrase ""it gets better"". it feels contrived and inauthentic. it's the poor man's way of saying ""i get what you're saying, but i don't have the emotional capacity to support you right now"". and that's fine, if that is the purpose it's supposed to serve. it's a slogan, a catch-phrase, and not an effective means of providing emotional support or insight. it's the ""got milk?"" or ""just do it!"" of depression support advocates. i'm genuinely not sure what aspect of depression it is supposed to hint at, aside from perhaps the small percentage of mdd/gad sufferers that feel drive toward self harm and suicide - and even then, i think would hate to hear this if i were in that position. **does anyone feel the same way? is there perhaps any other phrase or word that ""triggers"" (for lack of a better word) anger or negative feelings relating to depression/anxiety?** to keep this from being an entirely negative discussion, feel free to add and discuss the aspects of your treatment plan that you've had success with. for me, after years of genuinely perfectionist approach to lifestyle (diet, exercise, sleep), beginning a regime of ssri in the form of lexapro was the first thing that made me feel as though my situation was improving. best of luck, everyone. i just felt as though this was the proper place to share my negative outlook and maybe get some feedback.",Depression

"i deliver pizza. sometimes people will put silly things in the delivery instructions. a lot of 16-22 girls will casually sexually objectify us by putting things like, ""send the cutest boy!"" or something like that. i don't like it, but whatever. the drawbacks of living in a patriarchy is that teen girls can be gross leches and get away with it, i just try and do my job. we don't get to pick what orders we take. so i got stuck with one that said ""send your cutest boy"". i do not have very good self esteem. i once weighed close to 300 pounds, but through diet and a lot of exercise i've been able to get down to 230. i was sexually abused when i was 5 years old and have ptsd from it. i've spent my life feeling beyond ugly. sick and just repellent. when i made the delivery, the girl made a face at me. like not just a ""oh darn. a guy who looks about 29 and isn't a star athelete (like some of the guys i work with)."" it was a full on, ""ugh"" face. she tipped me and i gave her good service and was very polite despite feeling very offended to be judged when i'm just trying to do my job and didn't ask for this. later that night i find out she actually put ""i ordered the cutest delivery boy and didn't get it"" as a complaint in our feedback form which can both be seen by literally everyone i work with as well as our corporate office. so my entire store knows i was called ugly. and because of my self esteem issues...despite knowing this girl is a sexist asshole, i have felt like i'm about as attractive as a puss filled tumor all night. i could call this person up and let her know what her cruelty did to me. i could write all this up in a note and leave it at her door, but all it would do is make me look crazy because a 17 year old with bad skin and a terrible dress sense called me ugly and made me feel 2 inches tall after trying to sexually objectify me when i'm just trying to do my damn job. thank you for reading. you're a nice person and i love you.",Depression

the truth is everyone wants to be around someone who exhumes positive energy and someone who is funny and confident. a depressed person is everything opposite of that. i want to say that you should reach out to people for help but i gotta say that you have to careful who you reach out to. it could also destroy friendships. the thing is not everyone is in the right headspace to help another person and some people are just not mentally mature enough to help. edit: i want to emphasize that i might not be able to respond to every reply but everyone's comment is important.,Depression

"i’ve been depressed for a long time. in my depression, i’d often neglect brushing my teeth. now i have a tooth that’s turning black, and i can’t afford to get it fixed. my other teeth could be fucked as well. i don’t know how much it could be to treat all of them, but i can’t afford it. i simply can’t afford it. they fucking hurt. i’m a 19 year old girl, and i’m probably going to lose a tooth or maybe even a few due to my mental health problems. i don’t know what i’m going to do. how am i supposed to get a good job with missing teeth? who would want to date me? how will i be able to deal with the judgment and shame? how will i ever get the money to fix them or get dentures? i’m in pain and there’s nothing i can do. i’m even more depressed now and it’s my own damn fault. so that’s why i’m asking you all, please, if you can bring yourself to do one thing each day, let it be taking care of your teeth. showering can be skipped for a few days, but skipping brushing your teeth for a few days and making that a habit can be really bad and really expensive. i don’t want you guys to go through this too. don’t make my mistake. please brush your teeth.",Depression
"i just feel like i'm weak some days. i'm good at hiding it but i always tell myself ""maybe you're not depressed. maybe you pretend to be this way"" a lot. am i the only one. even when im fighting back tears, feel like dying, hoping that someone hits me on my motorcycle or just feeling like i have no energy because i feel completely drained after fighting it all day.",Depression
"it’s what the title says. i’m active socially and i make new friends when i can. one thing i can’t seem to have is a romantic relationship with someone. i’ve reached the point where i don’t care about it anymore. i tried and nothing comes of it, just heartbreak and despair. i envy those around me who are in happy relationships while i sit alone.",Depression

"one of my only hobbies is keeping small animals like bugs and amphibians. afew months ago my favorite spider died after it was doimg so well, and now my scorpion ended up thr same way. it was less than a year old, i had almost ideal conditions for it. it was eating and drinking regularly. i came home from an 11 hour school day to find it flat and unresponsive. i was completely crushed. i just stared and stared, i didn't want to believe it. i started to cry, i didn't even realize until my tears dripped onto its body. it wasn't just some bug, it was one of my few shreds of happiness in my life. watching it eat, explore its enclosure, seeing it dig new dens, but now its gone.. thanks for the kind words everybody, it means a lot :)",Depression
i got the email and got super excited. i told my parents through text and felt good for the first time in weeks. then i got an email a few minutes later saying that email was a mistake and i didn't get in. that's what i get for thinking things will go right for once. back to feeling depressed i guess.,Depression
"i'm 20, never had a girlfriend and basically gave up on trying dating girls for all the rejections i got. one day i meet this girl, pretty cute one too. she actually started the conversation for some informations but we kept talking and talking and in the end i asked her number. we messaged a little bit, she sounded so enthusiastic all the time. i thought i was ready to try getting into a relationship, set my depressing thoughts aside, i even forgot i found myself to be ugly... so i just had my first date. during that moment, i felt the happiest i've ever been in my life. i liked everything about her, and could feel a connection. i'd personally say the date went well, but that might have not felt the same on the other side. during the date everything seemed so fine, i could totally feel a connection between us. we laughed, talked about everything. we didn't kiss or anything but i was so happy. i genuinely was very happy. this is something i almost never feel because i always fall into a pit of depression after that. the morning after i decided to send her a message on whatsapp and... she blocked me. i thought maybe she just deleted whatsapp without a warning, but no. she showed up when i checked another number. she had erased me. on whatsapp. on facebook. i called her days later, hoping to not feel clingy, but she hang up immediately. 'she might call me back' i said, so i sent her a sms telling her to write or call back when she can. nothing. weeks passed and my mind is still full of doubts and i can't stop worrying about what i did wrong and why she did this, and my depression has gotten way worse. i don't know what to think. did something go wrong? does she just not find me attractive at all?has she already found someone? why did she even bother? i honestly want an answer but i'm so frustrated that i can't get one back. i feel like i was so close to something so special and it's already gone. nightmares are waking me up. i'm too weak for this stuff, i have no idea how other people handle this.",Depression
"sometimes i feel like i'm not depressed... i'm just lazy. i lack motivation. i lack self-confidence. i like to complain and whine and talk about how hard life is. i feel so guilty when i'm sad, because maybe i'm just feeling sorry for myself. i'm just self-absorbed and immature. and if i would just stop being so selfish and lazy, then i would be normal like everyone else. but... i'm so sad. i can't help that i feel this way. and i exercise and i try to eat right. i work hard. i make plans with friends. i try not to drink too much. i don't do drugs. but i get home and i'm alone, i feel so sad. so alone. so hopeless. i don't want to work. i don't want to try anymore. i just want to give up on everything. but when i talk to friends or family, they just tell me that everyone has problems. life is hard and just suck it up. and it will get better. ""you'll get through it"". but i'm 29. when does it just get better? when does all of my hard work and effort turn into happiness? i feel like even the counselors i've been to don't want to hear my complaining. they just tell me to breath more when i feel anxious. like, fuck you! what do you think i'm doing! i go to yoga regularly and i'm still fucking anxious. i go jogging. i do weight lifting. i go for walks. i read. and i'm still do sad. but then again, maybe it's just me. maybe i'm just doing this all wrong. i should be able to figure out how to make myself better. i should be able to stop myself from being sad all the time. but no one wants to help me. no one wants to listen to me complain. i can see it in there eyes when i start to talk about my struggles. they can barely wait for me to change the subject. tl;dr how do you know if your depressed or if you just suck at life? i try so hard to make myself better but maybe in the end i'm just lazy and self-absorbed and that's why in unhappy. update: thank you all for your replies and kind words. i'm amazed this post got so many comments and likes. and even though i don't know you guys, it has made me feel really supported on these really bad days. i saw a new psychologist today who diagnosed me with with an adjustment disorder, coupled with anxiety and depression. she referred me to a prescriber, but i have to wait a couple weeks for an appointment. hopefully i can get some meds then. even though i don't feel any better, it's a little comforting to have a diagnosis. and even more comforting to know this community exists. thank you so much.",Depression
"like every typical family, every year we get together and celebrate christmas. but i sit there, with a fake smile, pretending to laugh at everyones jokes, knowing that the next day and the day after and the day after that and the day after that... i'll be alone again sitting in my racing mind.",Depression
"everyday in high school i see people who can be engaged in certain classes and discussions out of what seems like interest. sometimes i see or hear about a student who went above and beyond on something. or, at the very least, i notice people who can do work and study for tests reasonably ahead of time. every time i see one of these things i feel jealous, sad, and sometimes almost resentful that i can't share this feeling of passion about a subject or school in general. as a student trying to go through an advanced curriculum, i feel especially out of place. my only ""passions"" are playing video games and browsing the internet, which is more of an escape habit than something i get excited about. even video games become a chore some days. everyone else seems to have found their way, or at least an area they're interested in, whereas i look at various subjects and don't feel remotely interested in any of them. college is coming next year, and i have no idea what i'm going to do, or if i even have the motivation to make it through. it's been difficult enough pretending like i care in high school. any kind of work is just a massive mental chore to get through. if it weren't for my massive anxiety and fear of falling out, i probably wouldn't get anything done.",Depression
"i think it’s become a canned statement. they say “miss you”, but they never do anything to prove it. they don’t make plans with you or call you. it’s like they forget about you until maybe they see a post you’ve made in social media or whatever that makes them feel better by telling you they miss you.",Depression
i literally cannot focus on anything. i can't pay attention in class. i can't study. i can't read a book. i can't even pay attention to video games. i can't watch a 10 min youtube video. i'm constantly zoning out. i'm just mindlessly going through life without really enjoying anything. edit : thanks for all your replies. i didn't know so many of you were feeling the same way as me. glad to know i'm not alone. gives me a bit of hope.,Depression

"so there we were arguing who fucked up the relationship, she'd never agree that it was her fault. i'd always apologize even if i was wrong. i refused to apologize and it all fucked up. she knew i had depression when we were in relationship. i told her i feel depressed and she said ""there's no such thing as depression"" anyway, she found out from out our common friend that i visited my doctor to get help and will begin medication soon. so at the end of the chat,i told her i'm not okay and she is making me feel even more bad, she should just leave me alone, so she dropped the bomb and said ""i don't give a fuck even if you die"" i stopped texting her after that. i was already having suicidal thoughts, but since now she wants me to die, i fucking won't. fuck you.. i'll outlive you , you stupid piece of shit. edit: just came home and saw your replies. i'm overwhelmed seeing your responses. in the process of opening up and sharing my experience with you, even if i can help one person, i'd be the happiest person in this world.",Depression

"when other people see me, they see a beige mass of carbon named robert. they see brown eyes, blackish hair and if they’re observant, a mole on my nose. they see a son, a brother, a stranger, a student, a friend. sometimes i’d even agree with them. then there’s the version of me that only i can see. when i look in the mirror, i see a liar, a faker, and a freak. i see an overly sensitive, repulsive little goblin with more misery in his heart than he knows what to do with. usually, my emotions are overshadowed by a deep feeling of worthlessness. when it’s really bad, i feel nothing at all. imagine you’re lying down on your bed. now imagine you have one hundred kilograms on your chest, no-let’s make that two hundred kilograms. with all the added weight it can be hard to move, but if you’re really strong you can still do it. now let’s add shackles, you are now bound to your bed by a metal chain. with all the weight on your chest, you barely have the breath to yell for help but you still manage to do it. but that’s not enough, the shadow that consumes you doesn’t want any company. now imagine being sedated. although the sedative makes you sleepy it doesn’t put you to sleep. all it does is makes you incoherent so you're unable to cry for help. this is what it feels like on a good day. on a typical day, you get everything i mentioned above plus the voices. the voices sound like nails being dragged across a chalkboard while a cat is getting crushed inside a blender. they tell you that you are a worthless, miserable, unlovable waste of a human being that probably would have been better off had you never been born at all. they remind you that life is pointless, painful, and absurd. you begin to think that you’re probably better off dead. on the really bad days you listen to these thoughts. all the while, you are completely unable to communicate these feelings to anyone you care about. you begin to think a veil has been lifted and you now see the world for how it really is. in reality, you are now seeing the world with a different set of eyes, through the veil of depression. you are absolutely terrified of being exposed. you fear people will see you as weak and vulnerable, you fear finding out that people don’t care, but more than anything you fear the stigma, and that’s what stops you from getting help. so you go it alone and face these feelings entirely by yourself.",Depression

october after 6 years of college and multiple majors, 6 classes shy of graduating because i just didn’t wanna do it anymore. i was burned out and sick of busting my ass with nothing to show for it but exhaustion and stress. i may or may not go back. my student loans are due starting in june which i can’t afford. i have a car payment on top of it, paying for a car that i never wanted in the first place with money that i don’t have. i only bought it to shut my parents up about it, because my other one which i much prefer wouldn’t pass emissions for a completely bullshit reason but ran and drove perfectly all the same. i just absolutely fucking hate being told what i can and can’t do with my own damn car that i pay for 100% myself. my car is my therapist and my favorite thing that i own. i’m working a dead end job with no room for promotion or growth, and coronavirus got me laid off indefinitely til the whole mess dies down. i cannot possibly be expected to pay for all that shit when they know damn well millions of people are losing their fucking jobs. it’s been a month since quarantine and i can’t really even leave my house. can’t have a social life. just feel like i have no one to turn to and i’m drowning. every fucking day and i’m just done. i left my house earlier this evening fully intending on making it a one way trip. i waited til my family had all gone to bed, then i got in my car and just took off. i drove 2 hours away, into the next state looking for a good spot to carry it out. i eventually found a cliff and pulled up and just sat there for a few minutes looking out over it, trying to find the balls to drive over the edge. i got out of my car and sat on the hood just staring into the distance and started crying, thinking to myself how the fuck it came to this and how alone i felt. i was sitting there in the dark with tears streaming down my face when i heard a car pull up behind me and felt flashing blue lights. i knew it was a cop at this point but didn’t bother trying to hide myself. i just leaned on the hood of my car and continued crying to myself. he approached with a flashlight and noticed me. apparently he thought my car was abandoned at first. he was a young guy, probably about my age. he asked for my license and registration which i gave him. i’d said maybe two words to him at this point, and i think he picked up on the fact that i seemed a bit off. he asked me how i was doing and what i was doing so far from home at this time of night. it was like 1 am at this point. i just said that i needed to get out and clear my head at first, but eventually i admitted that i had driven up here to kill myself. i thought he was gonna freak out and cuff me and drag me kicking and screaming to a mental hospital, but he actually was remarkably calm. he asked why and what was going on in my life. he even came over and sat next to me on the hood of my car and listened. i had stopped crying but the tears came flooding back as it all came out, how i felt like i had no one. he didn’t interrupt and even put an arm around me. i eventually said i planned to drive my car off this cliff because i was so unhappy. he was silent for a few seconds and then told me he knew how it feels to want to die. apparently he came close to suicide a few times. a quote he said really stuck with me. it was “sometimes you can have everything and it still feels like nothing.” and it hit me that that was exactly how i felt. he gave me his personal number and said to call or text any time of day if i needed to talk. we sat there til about 2:30ish just talking. it was so nice to just vent to someone. eventually he said that he had to get going, but knowing what i just told him, we both knew he couldn’t leave me there alone for obvious reasons. he walked me back to my car and reminded me that he gave me his number. he walked back to the police cruiser and backed out, flashing his headlights at me to do the same. he followed me to the highway, turning off onto a side road and honking as he drove away while i got on the entrance ramp. i drove the 2 hours back home, not completely believing what had just happened and how he saved my life. i never even got his name or badge number. i got home close to 5 this morning and no one was up yet luckily. i snuck in and went to my room and slept for about 3 hours. i gave no indication to my family that i tried suicide the night before. no one knew that i went out last night. i still haven’t told them and i don’t plan to. they have no idea that i could’ve died. i called the officer’s number and left him a voicemail thanking him again. he texted me later in the day saying his offer was still valid any time. i have no idea if he had to fill out any paperwork and don’t really want to ask. everyone has at least one secret that they’ll take to their grave, and this is probably mine. it’s a long shot that he’ll read this but if he does, i don’t know what to say to him or how to thank him. his compassion saved my life. it’s crazy to think what would’ve happened if he had taken a different patrol route and hadn’t come along when he did. he deserves a promotion and to win the lottery. i owe him my life. cops get a bad rap for being arrogant, power hungry racists with itchy trigger fingers, but this particular officer represents what humanity should be like. we wouldn’t have people killing themselves if we simply stopped being assholes to each other. i don’t know if there’s a department medal for talking a suicidal person off the ledge, literally in my case, but he deserves it. i could probably call his department number and get his name and send him something in the mail. not a bad idea. godspeed officer. i’ll never forget this and how someone cared, and cared enough to actually do something about it.",Depression

it's like they have their very own reality where they are worshipped and they know everything. you confide in someone about your depression and they somehow make you feel like it's your fault. no wonder so many people don't seek help. no wonder so many people commit suicide. it's sad but it's today's world and i don't wanna be a part of it anymore.,Depression

"i need to rant. this person i met at uni, and now live with, uses suicide and mental health as a cute personal characteristic about themselves. about a week of knowing them they randomly told me they had a date set for their suicide- it was a couple days after their mum's birthday. this is what first started making me dislike them. recently, i have found out that their 'suicide attempt' was that they thought about taking pills. that is not a suicide attempt. you didn't try to kill yourself, you thought about it. they openly talk about how they're suicidal and 'tried' to kill themselves to my friend, who is such a lovely person and has tried to kill himself and then they constantly stare at his scars making him feel uncomfortable. he does not deserve this person bragging about their suicide. they say this shit to me too. they do not know what it is like to try to kill yourself. they did not have their dad yelling and asking why they took pills whilst sat on the floor crying. they did not have to watch their dad call their mum to come home from work straight away because her daughters took an overdose. they did not have to watch their brothers concern faces leave the room from their parents forcing them upstairs. they did not have to avoid eye contact with their parents in the hospital because their sad faces broke their heart. they did not sleep for an entire day because of the side effects of taking tablets. i did. and they think it is something to tell everyone they meet as if its a fun little fact. all they did was brag about it to their mates. fuck off. the look of my parents face's when i tried to kill myself is etched into my memory. they did not experience that. they do not have to right to flaunt it around in my face as though it is not affecting anyone else around them who has actually attempted suicide. im sorry this is long and ive already posted but there are things i need to get off my chest",Depression
"what's your opinion on them? i somewhat appreciate the intention behind them, but god damn do they feel empty and meaningless. same thing with the ""internet hugs"" thing that some people love to post. i'm sure those people have only good intentions, but what that actually ends up doing is making me wish i actually had someone to hug in real life. and since i don't, it just makes me feel worse. to me it's also the same as when people simply post a bunch of suicide hotline numbers when people admit to being suicidal. they just want to feel like they helped. i don't think those things help very much for someone with deep emotional pain though. band-aid over a gunshot wound, yknow.",Depression
"because they don't see it, they assume it's gone/not real. when you have a broken bone, or a physical illness, people ask how you're doing, and when you say it hurts, they believe you. they don't constantly act surprised when you show symptoms. when you're depressed, and you have a bad day, they'll be like ""what's wrong ? what's happening ? are you mad ?"" even when they know you're suffering from depression, a disease that's literally known for making people feel like shit.",Depression

"i’m 22, senior in college, and some days i’m in up to four classes. if i don’t have to work that day, work requires me to talk, i can go through the entire day with having little to no interaction with another human. no one texts me throughout the day, no one talks to me before or after classes, and i feel as though no one even looks at me when i walk down the street, beyond the cashier at the cafe telling me my coffee and donut is $3, i feel as though i don’t exist. i’m not suicidal but that doesn’t mean the thought that if i’d i disappear the entire world would continue moving without noticing hasn’t graced my mind. to complicate things i’ve even walked by friends, best of friends, without them noticing me or saying hi, even if i make an attempt to. i try to just enjoy my walk but being surrounded by so many people makes me feel claustrophobic. today in particular i decided to dress nicer, maybe i’d get someone to notice me. i wore something my ex-gf had always thought i looked handsome in. the painful reality is that i felt even more alone today, more distant from the entire society of college that i wanted to run as far as i could away from it. people are always telling me that “if you want to make friends or meet a girl, you have to be the one to make that first conversation” but if that’s the case why isn’t any ever trying to make that conversation with me. thank-you for noticing me today.",Depression

"hi everyone, i'm 24 y/o female, my brother is a 19 y/o. mid may, my brother was taken to the hospital for attempting suicide. his online friends called his college to request a wellness check and got the cops involved. they found him unconscious in his dorm room. we have a very toxic mom. to give you some context, my mom told him ""do it right the next time so we don't have to drive 8 hours to pick you up."" she loves us but she's very immature, toxic, physically abusive, mentally abusive, etc. she's sort of a horrible human being but in her mind, she has done all she can for us. she had me when she was 19, single mom, we don't talk to our dad. he's set on doing it again because my brother and i have an extremely close relationship and he doesn't want to be a burden on me. he has been failing school, hates my mom, and feels like if he kills himself, my life will become better because my mom will realize she is the problem. but my mom will never know that. he thinks i'll be sad for a couple of years but i'll get through it because i'm a strong person. he has told my boyfriend that he has bought 100 pills this time for his second attempt. my brother is the best. but my mom has fucked him up so much. he feels like he doesn't deserve my love and feels extremely guilty that i'll have to take care of him when i went through so much to get where i am. i just graduated with a masters degree and looking for a job on the west coast. i also want to note there is a genetic component. on my mom's side, my grandpa, my uncle have killed themselves. my mom has attempted suicide when i was in high school by jumping off our apartment but survived. i have been depressed since age 7 but became healthy two years ago. my brother has felt this way since he was 10. i told him once i get a job i can take him away forever and help him get his life back on track but he doesn't want to burden me. what do i do? has anyone been in a situation like this?",Depression

"i had to turn in my notes for a class, and forgot that i had a bunch of private writing in there. my teacher saw it, showed it to my other teachers, and eventually the principal, who sent me to the school therapist... it was the most embarrassing thing i've ever had to endure. i was called up to the school therapist's office and she showed me some scans of the journal and asked me what was up. it was a series of self deprecating shit about how much of a cunt i am. she had me explain why i was feeling that way, etc. i was in that room for about 2 hours. sounds like an awful situation, right? it turned out to be one of the best days of my life (but somehow still awful). i was just like a lot of you guys, being afraid to seek help, feeling that it would not work/be a waste of time, even in the morning today. i got the (it didn't seem like it at the time) privilege of getting the help brought to me. i learned today that shit like this can work. when i say work, i really mean it: * i was able to tell somebody the actual struggles that i have for the first time in my life. * they are objective people, they will always understand * i openly told them that i wanted to kill myself, and i was not brought to a hospital or whatever, per my request. * my teachers have now built an understanding of why i have d's in all of their classes. * my family didn't and won't ever know a thing * i was able to get a proper clinical diagnosis that i do have depression (helpful, in the sense that it's now set in stone as an actual thing, and i can better understand it all) what was bad about it? * it was uncomfortable * it was embarrassing. take the fact that this is the only positive post that i have put on this sub (not about me nearly taking my life, or hating it) and realize that there is actual help to be had. even when it's uncomfortable as fuck, as i have come to find out. i'm still not happy, or even content. but i'm more sensible with thinking about the shit that has been going on in my life forever, and am able to think of it with a more realistic perspective. if anyone has any more questions or any advise for people reading this, unsure if they want some guidance or not? please, by all means put something down below. thank you, all.",Depression

"god dammit, i'm almost 24. i don't know what having someone choose to care is like. i forget what meaningful human contact is like. and you know what? when i was a kid.i wanted to know what all that was like. i wanted a girlfriend. i wanted to have sex, maybe eventually have a kid. i still want that, but you know what i want even more? to not want any of that. i don't want to feel anything. i want to be okay with nobody ever choosing to love me. i want to be okay with sleeping alone til i die. i know it's likely going to turn out that way, so why can't i just die inside already? this is fucking painful, and nobody cares (not that anyone should but that doesn't make it hurt any less). i always get accused of feeling ""entitled to a girlfriend"" or ""entitled to sex"" when that couldn't be further from the truth. i am entitled to nothing except death. i get it. i see the game, and i see the score. so why can't i stop wanting things i can never have? why can't i stop wanting affection and just move on? fuck being human.",Depression

"people only think about themselves. your own pain doesnt matter, its just the pain for others, mentally healthy people they want to avoid. please dont confuse this with people who dont commit suicide because of other people - this is not what i am talking about. trying to push through by thinking about others is completely different than telling someone that their pain doesnt matter or matters less than the pain of others. imagine going to the doctor because of a broken leg and they tell you that you shouldn't have broken your leg because now people will have to help you get around and maybe drive you, and then they send you home again. thats stupid and bullshit. and if you go through with it and end it, people will either cry that they would have helped you, while we all know they wouldnt have, or they will blame you even further for ""hurting your mother"" or ""hurting your children"" etc. excuse me?? someone died to an illness and that is all you have to say? there was a threat once about someone who tried to kill themselves but failed - and everyone blamed them for the pain they inflicted on their parents (not the comments on reddit, comments irl they got). i was livid. our main focus should be to help people, not their relatives while pretending we can ignore their pain in hope they will too. we should talk about their pain, about their suffering, their fear. everyone is so quick to say ""oh yes mental illnesses are real ofc"" but when they are confronted with it they are ignorant. i dont think you can always keep going because of others. one day it will be too much. you need to put yourself first sometimes. the title might be misleading because you can say it - if its clear that this is not the only reason to not end your life and that your pain matters, but i cant write an essay in the title and i hardly ever heard someone say it without the worst judgement in their voice so...",Depression

"i'm 18 and i've... honestly struggled with depression for as far as i can recall being alive. i know a lot of people feel like depression is the emotional equivalent of watching paint dry, or just constant numbness, but for me it was pure agony. every second of my life was spent hopeless and wanting to die. something else a lot of people say is that depression has its ups and down, and i don't remember having any ups at all; it was just a constant downward slope for me and i felt more and more hopeless by the day. i could not get out of bed. some days it was so bad that i would scratch my thighs violently with my nails and lie on the pool of blood created on my mattress because i had the urge to hurt myself but i couldn't even be assed to get out of bed to get something sharp. if i were to rate it on a scale of one to ten, one being normal and ten being constantly being stabbed by burning knives in every inch of your body, i would give it an eleven. the only thing that kept me alive was my desire to pursue a career in astrophysics, but even that was slipping out of reach because studying was unthinkable for someone in my state. on january 7th of this year i decided i had enough and posted a suicide note on here, headed to the bathroom to try to drink bleach, but i couldn't bring myself to do it. because minutes after i had locked myself in, 7 of my friends burst in through the front door asking my grandma where i was and if i was okay, because they had called several times in the past hour and i had not answered them. they had even brought me all of my favorite snacks. they put on my favorite movie from my childhood (finding nemo) and we watched it all cuddled up together on my bedroom floor eating the snacks while one of the girls braided my hair and tied it with a white ribbon that i still have. i wish i could say that this was the turning point, but sadly it wasn't. however their love made me feel so warm inside. it definitely made me think twice about attempting suicide again. it took me another month and a week until i gathered the balls to see a psychiatrist, which with my abusive family situation is the bravest fucking thing i have ever done. i ignored my mother screaming about how psychiatrists are evil and will try to lock her up in jail and i had my dad drive me to my first appointment and by god i will forever celebrate february 15th as the day i was given a second shot at life. i was scared to death but my psychiatrist is such a nice guy and i felt like talking to a best friend (he even showed me pictures of his cat, a black little fella called pumpkin but he did not respond to that so they just called him fufi). i was put on 50 mg of zoloft, a brief prescription for clonotril (a different brand name for klonopin, so clonazepam) for when i was having panic attacks or trouble sleeping, and a reference for a therapist. at first my mother tried to withhold my meds, then tried to convince me that i should take them at evening because that's when some doctor friend of hers said i should, and i did and i could not fucking sleep all night. i took zoloft properly for the first time the next morning. it took three weeks to kick in. i only realized that it had when i found myself laughing myself to tears while my best friend tried to open a beer bottle with his belt buckle when we were in the middle of a cinema watching battle angel alita. i don't think i had ever felt unadulterated joy before. it felt so fucking good dude, i can't even describe how fucking amazing it feels to spend your entire life in agony and suddenly you're happy! and you never thought you would ever feel such an emotion! and with the help of my therapist i started making a lot of progress in a short time. honestly, when i thought about the possibility of recovery i always imagined it would take me, like, at least a couple of years. i surprised myself by being able to get out of bed and go for a jog after only a month and a half. i would not say i am cured. i have a long, long way to go, but at least this time i'm walking and not crawling towards my destination, hell, i finally even have a destination. i feel like a proper human for the first time since i can remember and i can finally fully dedicate myself to my beloved astrophysics and get better at it. i used to spend my saturday evenings crying myself to sleep. now i go out with my wonderful friends and meet new people, play guitar on stages in front of crowds which i never even imagined i could do let alone have people come up to me after the show and tell me i kick ass at guitar, have dinner without wanting to throw up because i feel fat and disgusting, and if i stay in i spend my night drawing or writing music or studying. i used to be unable to fall asleep and when i did i would get the worst nightmares. my sleep isn't that good to be honest, but the quality has improved and i no longer sleep for 15 hours straight if not woken up. i used to have panic attacks when strangers talked to me. now i have made so many new friends, and they all say that my sense of humor is great! i never even thought of myself as a funny person! i am so fucking thankful to whatever deity is responsible for my road to recovery. i can't believe that i have hope. i am actually crying as i type this because feeling emotion is such a new thing for me and god fucking damn it, it feels amazing. i hope everyone gets to experience something like this because it's the best fucking thing ever. i am human now.",Depression
"well, today marks 24 years from the day i was born. and for as long as i can remember, it's still one shitty fucking birthday. last year was pretty shitty. i lost my best friend, my job, had not a dime to my name and was suicidally depressed. this year i'm on medication and i'm trying to be happier, to move on and to make a better man out of myself and to just try to be.... better. of course life wants to bitch slap me in the fucking face. so far since waking up i've found out that the police have recovered my wallet that was stolen a week ago. the wallet that had every shred of id in it. all the id was torn to pieces and purposefully destroyed and stuffed back in the bill folds. so i found out that someone maliciously fucked with my shit. great. then i went to the bank to check how little money i had. see if i could get something for my birthday. on the way someone picks my pocket and steals my new wallet. only thing in there was my bank card, but still disheartening. i go into the bank, they gave me a ton of shit for having to get a new card as if it was my fucking fault that i've had my shit stolen. i find out i've got $3. cool. i go back to the homeless shelter i'm staying at and i get an email from family. $30 for my birthday! sweet! i can get like a single can of beer, or a cupcake or just something to commemorate the fact it's my birthday. not too much to ask i'd say. i deposit it only to find out in the fucking couple hours since i checked my bank account, they've taken out the monthly fees. there were other bank fees and yet another statement fee that they keep not reversing or taking off my account despite getting no statements. all in all? -$29. so i had about 68 cents to play with by the time it was all said and done. i mean is it too much to ask for a fucking break in my fucking life? for one fucking day where i can actually say that it's fucking mine and i can enjoy it or do i have to suffer through this fucking bullshit for the next goddamn century? if so i'll fucking finish it now. i am so fucking sick of this shit. fuck!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",Depression

"kinda shitty advice. but i'll start with some backstory. i'm on mobile so forgive me. (this will be kinda rambly) i was diagnosed with bipolar and anxiety disorder after i checked into a psychiatric hospital a few years back, but i always felt as i grew up that something was wrong. when i went to go meet my biological mother (who is very bipolar) when i was 18 things started to click with me that i needed to figure out a way to find meaning. it didn't help that my step-mom was an abusive cunt. so overall i kinda suck at being a person.(still do) anyways, i've struggled with constantly feeling down, and also feeling a whole lotta shit i didn't really understand. because of this i turned to weed and alcohol when i was 15. went through a few phases of drinking hard, but really weed was my poison of choice(still dont think it's bad but that's for another sub). again anyways because of the plant i kinda regained a sense of what it meant to be a healthy functioning member of society, but it was only a sense. a taste of what its like to kinda face things with some objective stoicism. a new perspective. but its a fading remedy, a bandaid. it doesn't address the core of the problem. well, new years eve 2018 i get arrested for an ounce of pot and a gram of shrooms. as i stood there with those cuffs on i couldnt help but think ""damn, cant catch a break.."" that was a low point, sitting in that cell. in my own cell with anklets as if i were the most dangerous person in there. statistically speaking i kinda was, at least the type of person most frequently shot by police, a mentally ill colored man mid 20s. but i just wanted to feel better. for the past 15 years constantly thinking of the relief dying would be. those thoughts popped right back into my head with my ass on that cold bench. how nice it would be to not be a burden to my dad. i'm tired of feeling that way and to this day i feel that way. but... a human life doesnt last that long and i know one day ill die anyways. its the only thing promised when you're born is that you'll die. so i observe those thoughts and counter them with the former. ""i wanna die. -you will."" so how do i make this time count if none of it really matters. what do i do with this big cosmic joke of an existence? i make it worth it for my dad. we struggle. sometimes we dont know how we'll pay the rent, things get complicated with family, with work, with life. and all of it together makes me wanna opt out. but then i think of leaving him by himself to deal with it himself and what a living hell that would be. even if i cant do much, ill do what i can till i can't. because if i dont that would make me sadder than anything i can ever encounter in my life. my point is that out there there are strong, amazing, incredibly intelligent and driven people, who do this shit alone. while feeling everything. and its heart breaking. my dad spent his life trying to make me feel welcome when every fiber of my being says i don't belong on this earth. the least i can do is gtfo bed and try to do something. even if my battle that day is just to brush my teeth. so that he can see a good looking smile that he made. to make him feel just a little better. that's my part, my mission. thats what gets me up. there are people that can use your help, and you owe it to them. but that s just my opinion.",Depression

it just seems so strange to me that most people don’t spend every waking moment hating themselves and thinking about death. like while they’re waiting for the train what do they think about if not jumping on the tracks and ending it right there? or seeing a building and wondering if the impact of jumping from it will be enough to kill them? do they just look at a tree with strong branches and think “what a nice tree that is” instead of which branch would be best to hang myself from? how is it possible that some people just don’t want to die? not to mention so many people who go through painful and expensive treatments just to stay alive. it makes me feel so guilty for all the times i’ve wished to get cancer so i can die without having to do anything. i wish i could donate my physical health to someone who needs it so i can just let my sick brain shrivel up and die.,Depression

And then he asks you what you did, and you say ""Don't worry, it won't land me in the hospital unless I tried hard enough, and it only involves me.

"My sister is being a real asshole to me (16 recently. My sister (22) is being a real asshole to me (16M) recently. I dont know if this is the right subreddit for this, but idk what else to do. She always acts like she is my parent and enforces so many rules on to me and always argues with me. Just yesterday, she kept arguing with me over small things, like when I was making tea she just had to start an argument that I wasnt allowed to use the sugar (And mind you I was just tired from school and couldn't handle anything else for the day). She turned this in to a full blown conversation where she started shouting and swearing at me because I was giving little response to her claims (I was allowed to make tea with sugar, so I just said I can make tea). 

Then she blamed all this arguing on me never having a conversation with her or whatever. She told me I was not taking this relationship 'seriously enough' and I responded that she was taking it 'too serious'. She might have been right about the conversation thing, but honestly, I think I dont like to talk a lot after school since I'm just tired and I am a teen and an introvert, while she has the exact opposite personality as me. So, I always answer any of her questions like what was you test like with it was good, or what did you do at school with the lessons I did that day. She says that I am the problem, even though I think she's trying to be way too involved in my life and always starts arguments with me. After she snapped yesterday, she started tatteltaling to my mom, everything I do. Which was impossible to deal with since I was trying to study for a test I have the next day (today). This ended in me going to sleep early, but before I went to sleep, she told me that I have to come to her tommorrow with a written statement or some dumb shit like that on what I will do 'to improve this relationship'. So that is where I'm at. I'm tired of her always being like this, but I dont know what to do. I feel like she should change, but when I told this to her, she was shocked that I hadn't noticed her change 'saying that she always used to tattletale and argue with me' but now she doesn't. I was just as shocked when she told me this, I feel like she hasn't changed one bit. 

Anyways, now I have to come to her with a written statement on what I should do tonight, which is where I need your guys help. I've never confessed anything like this before, but I don't know what to do.

TL;DR: My sister is being a real asshole, and now I need to come to her with a statement on what I should do to improve our relationship. Please help. Idk what to write or do

"Massive rant about a nice guy and the most awkward guy I knew This happened around January to March (When quaratine started). Let me set the scene, I'm a 16 year old girl, but I look like I'm 12 becuase I'm 4'11 (about 150 cms), I have some close friends, but not many.

I had known this kid in my history class for a while, he's your stereotypical dorky kid, a little awkward, but probably just a phase. He's also rather short (around 5'2 I think), he's also a freshman and 15 years old. Fast forward to January when I catch feelings for this boy (Probably since he gave me any kind of positive attention without blowing off my rude exterior). 

I tell my friends, and they want to meet him. I invited him to my friend group, where he ended up getting along extremely well. We all thought this would be a one time thing, however he keeps showing up; We don't really care, we just wonder where his friend group is. One day I'm texting him and this question pops up, he tells me he isn't that close to his friend group, and that's why he's with us. I don't think much of it, since he was kinda awkward and more feminine than other guys. I want him to play this game I really like, which he barely plays any of, and he tells me it's cause he's busy. (I realized he was lying and just didn't like the genre of the game, but I kept quiet)

Fast forward a few weeks, I'm hanging out with one of my other friends at the mall, getting ready to go to her house to play video games. I get a text from my crush, she asks me what I want from this. I tell her I don't really care when he finds out, I'm just too scared to say so myself. (I'm someone who gets over crushes very easily once I've been rejected, then I get another crush months to a year later) She and I decide that it would be better for her to just tell him I like him, because I want to be able to get over this as soon as possible.

Next week he's texting me every day, sometimes kinda creepy good morning texts, same time every day. Next thing I know he's also completed the game I asked him to play in a weekend. I ask him what he thought about it, exticed to have someone to talk about it to. I then quickly realize talking to him, he took the most minimal route to beat the game, missing out on more than half the game. I asked him why he would take the shortest way. He then turns on me to say that he took out a massive chunk of his weekend for this, and how stressed he felt from all his work, and that it was my fault he was feeling like that. 

It didn't take me long after to realize why he played the game, he didn't have a change of heart, he just wanted me to like him more. I soon then learn why he isn't connected to his friend group that much. He tells me, ""even though I help people with their problems, right after they ditch me"". By this point I'd realized, he's a nice guy. Somehow it got worse, between this revelation he'd told my other friend that he'd caught feelings for me, only after learning I might be into him. He also told her that the other reason he liked me, was becuase I was one of the few people shorter than him.

I end up trying to appear like I'm not into him, when I'm around my friend group, I talk about which video game characters I think are the cutest/hottest, which girls in the school I think are cute (I'm bi if you couldn't guess). One day, I'm feeling sick so I stay home and go to sleep earlier. I wake up in the morning to him confessing his feelings to me and annoyingly asking why I hadn't responded. I end up telling him that I'm just not into him, not telling him the anymore part of it. 

My friend group expect him to end up leaving, since I had rejected  him. Nope. He then got a crush on one of my friends becuase he saw her as ""easier"", she's not outspoken in any situation and comes off as very soft to people who don't know her that well. She wasn't into him because of how quickly he jumped ship from me to her. At this point he then starts to insert himself into any situation he can.

When my friends all planned to hang out and play Don't Starve Together, he asked to go along. We all said yes to not hurt his feelings, when we do meet up, all he does is play music and games on his phone. When we got bored of the game, me and him then played Pokemon Showdown together, I end up sweeping the floor with him multiple times. Rather than making a joke or anything, he then claims he kept on miss clicking, and had bad luck.

Eventually, he tells my friend he like her, she rejects him, only to still hang around us for no apparent reason. At this point we've all realized he's only tried to get along with all of us to get in me and my friend's pants. We try to distance ourselves from him by only talking about stuff he can't butt into. It doesnt work. He finally picked up on it when we started to take refuge in a classroom, after we told him that he might be along better with people in his grade.

"Tips to pulling an all-nighter I know y’all like staying up all night. It’s fun. You get to play video games and stuff. So from a person who’s had some experience, here’s some advice. 
1. Never look at the time. If you look at the time and you see it’s later than you normally stay up, your body will get pretty tired. 
2. Always have food or drink to give you energy. That’s the nature of food. It gives you energy.  Do NOT drink energy drinks  or caffeine unless it’s the tail-end of your all nighter. They will make you tired after they wear off. I’d recommend things like water or protein shakes to drink instead. 
3. Have something to distract you from your tiredness. You’re gonna be tired, but if you distract yourself, you won’t notice. Watching action movies or playing video games are some things you can do. If you’re studying for a test or doing homework, have music that will keep you awake. 
4. Don’t try too hard. Effort makes you tired. Just chill and act like this is your standard routine. 
And with that are my four tips. Feel free to criticize them or add your own in the comments.",Normal

A guy in my sixth grade class convinced me that “jacking off” was just rubbing your jaw muscles to relieve stress So I was in 6th grade at the time fresh out of elementary school and I still didn’t like hearing swearing at that time. So anyway my dumbass became friends with this guy in band class who was basically the definition of a trying to be edgy and tough kid. He and a few of his other friends thought that it would be funny to convince me that jacking off was rubbing you jaw muscles to relieve stress. He was t lying about all of it though it’s just rubbing in a different place to relieve stress that I found out about a year later. So they would say stuff like my dad jacks off after a long day of work or I love jacking off during school. Completely went over my head about what it really meant.  It wasn’t until my best friend Matthew told me that it wasn’t really just rubbing your face that I previously thought and he didn’t tell me what it really was for my sake. Anyway they kept trying to convince me that rubbing your face was just jacking off until eventually they got bored of that when I would just call them out on them lying.,Normal

"I could easily beat a goose in a fight Ok, so recently I saw the vine with the girl saying, “Look at all those chickens!” That led me to some videos of people encountering geese and running away when the demonstrated aggression. Some of the scared people were kids, which I get, but an adult!! Running away from a goose. 

I’m not the most physically strong or trained in any martial art, but I could easily beat the shit out of a goose if it came at me. It has nothing to attack me with, besides a bite with its bill, and they don’t even have sharp teeth that could puncture my skin. Geese aren’t that smart either, often times they just rush their target head on, without considering their inferior fighting capabilities. Most humans have long enough arms to reach out and stop a goose before they even get into biting range. Geese also have a major disadvantage because of their long necks, which are easy to grab with your hands. The final nail in the coffin in my opinion is that many of the geese I saw didn’t even use their greatest advantage over us, flight. 

TLDR: Geese are dumb, and I could probably beat one in a one v one fight so you could too. Have no fear of these silly waterfowl, for you are the superior predator.",Normal

She does have a current bf, which I don't wanna ruin that. I'd at least she break up with him before I rlly start trying to go for a relationship. 2. She's rlly cool, (I wouldn't say trendy but maybe a little) and my parents are hard-core fucking Christians, so if they saw her insta, or what she wears on occasion they might flip and I rlly don't want to drag her through either baratement from my parents or wearing something she doesn't want to. Her parents are also divorced which they rlly would think is wack. 3. I'm a complete asshole who plays videogames. She doesn't rlly play any, which is fine that doesn't bother me, but I just know that she deserves so much better than what I have to offer. I'm not rlly the nicest person to be around(partly due to my self hatred and suicidal thoughts, which again I don't want to drag her through) and I have no idea what I'm doing when it comes to being a good bf. With my last gf, it ended after a month bc we had gotten into an argument because she thought I was shunning her at school. I wasn't, I just didn't know how to act when I saw her in the halls.

"Please help me. I'm going nowhere in life and I don't want to live like this. This post may not be suitable for this sub, but I posted this on r/depression and r/suicidewatch, but got no comments and didn't show up in new, so I'm posting this in a psychology related subreddit.

Note: this was copied and pasted from my journal i started writing today. English isn't my first language, so please understand some grammar mistakes. I live in an asian country with a education system that grades students relatively, and puts more pressure onto the kids. So it may be different from the us.


A certain illness seems to have consumed me. Depression, anxiety.. I can't exactly describe what is eating me up from the inside, but I feel as if a parasite is slowly eating me alive.

Today was a bad day. I feel a temporary sense of comfort whenever I say the phrase ""today was a bad day"" in my head. It feels like that all the terrible feelings I'm having is just caused by a bad day, and that tomorrow things will be better and everything will come back to place. But it isn't. All my days are bad days. Some are worse than the others.

I had a bad stomachache while I was going to school, and the bus was crowded and everyone was loud. I hate school. I hate every aspect of it. The teachers standing near the entrance checking the kids' uniforms, the posters and screens displaying pretentious videos about college admission, the chairs that are too rigid to sit, the florescent lights that are too bright and cold, the constantly shifting schedule, the teachers who don't seem to care about the students yet talk about college admission all the time and pressure kids to choose a major and a future job and plan out their whole career at 16. The kids that are too loud. Everyone is too loud. Everything is too loud.

Sometimes I imagine what it would be like to be reincarnated into another person's body without my memory fully wiped. I feel like I'm living in another person's body. The only time I can feel truly myself is on the internet. I started a discord server a few days ago. Everyone was great, yet I felt miserable. I felt as if I was tricking them into thinking I was a smart and funny person. I haven't felt this in a while, and I cling onto that sense of self worth and belonging I can never get in real life. 

In real life, in school, in hagwon, it's different. I am still that star trek obsessed kid who thinks too much and tells weird jokes, but nobody knows be. Nobody knows who I am. Even my mom, my teachers, the kids in my school, nobody knows me. I can never talk about things I love in real life. I can't talk about html and building my own website with anyone, I can't talk about star trek or memes, I can't discuss philosophy or talk about how school sucks and how bad my day was. I feel like nobody gets me offline. I don't feel accepted. I feel like I'm the permanent new kid in my life.

I'm not seen as a smart kid anymore. When I was younger I was the gifted kid that always got stuff right, knew more stuff than the textbook, the kid who was always correcting the teacher, the kid who everyone asked things they didn't know. I was the kid whose teacher, when they called their parents, always told them how their kid was a bright and gifted kid. Everyone had high expectations for me, but now I'm disappointing everyone with my dropping grades and depression.

Tbh, I feel like I'm tricking everyone who views me as a smart person. I feel like an imposter who everyone mistook as the gifted kid when I was younger. I feel like I'm one of the the r/iamverysmart people who insecure with their intelligence. I feel like my whole childhood was a lie. 

Now people who don't know me well think I'm 'average"". Worse, they see me as a lazy, creepy kid who forgets everything, doesn't understand social cues and eats lunch alone. I feel as if there is an underlying, constant ""rage"" about myself and everyone in my life. The ""rage"" sometimes makes me want to kill myself, or worse, kill everyone in my school. I feel like a terrible person, a being who can't be even described as ""human"" when I find myself imagining blowing up my school with a bomb. That ""rage"" seems to come from my insecurity. I feel so insecure sometimes that it turns into a full blown panic attack like I would never feel happy again, like every inch of hope has been sucked out from me. 

I'm confused about my dreams and major too. One day I want to be a programmer/developer, one day I want to be a professor in philosophy/history/neuroscience/astronomy, one day I just want to earn a living and be on the internet and game all day, one day I want to be a writer, one day I just want to fucking kill myself. My teachers pressure kids to choose their future jobs/major quickly. They are always doing activities that involve kids to write down their future majors and careers. I can't be honest with anyone, sometimes myself too. I feel like that ruined my whole dreaming thing beginning in 2018. I stopped to think about my possibilities and stopped being honest with myself and always thought that I was too late and wasn't qualified.

Sometimes I have the sudden urge to get my shit together and do something with this life. Then after a day when I find myself forgetting an assignment or procrastinating, I feel as if I can't never get my shit together and fall back into that viscous cycle again. This has happened to much to me that it sucked away the hope and made me thing I was going to be doomed forever.

I would write more if I could, but I feel so sick to write. Please help me. I feel so miserable. I don't want to live like this anymore.",Normal

"Dear Moderators of this sub Another user made this post but it needs more light because it is true

 

i have been working hard to make relatable memes for my fellow teenagers, but they seem to be a poaching bot that doesn’t allow pre made formats. i feel like the addition to [u/MAGIC\_EYE\_BOT](https://www.reddit.com/u/MAGIC_EYE_BOT/) was nice because it eliminates possible reposting, but the bot just completely removes any post with pre-made templates.

For example: I have uploaded 3 different memes that I made with mematic, which were (not fully) origional content. i used a template and psoted my fresh relatable meme about a school scenario, and poof. 1 minute later, my post was removed because of: “identical or slihtly modified image recently posted here”. i think you should have the bots programmming reconstructed so the bot can depict the difference between text colour, position and other tags on post, so the meme doesn’t get taken down because of possible repost. im honeslty so mad about this because I see other memes using the template get posted, and not taken down.

i say this for probally more than just myself, but I would like the Magic Eye Bot removed from this sub.",Normal

"Katy Perry Gush :) ***hey guys, gals, and non binary pals :)***

so I'm bored and listening to music and I've recently started listening to some old Katy Perry songs that came out back when I was little. anddddd I have quite a lot to say about them. :) nobody probably cares tho lol. but basically, I'm just gonna be gushing about her songs and lyrics cuz why not? if you're not interested, you can keep scrolling and ignore this lol. I'm open to having a discussion or gush afterwards in the comments if you end up reading my post. either way, hope you all have a great rest of your day/night! :)

so to begin: I absolutely love how the majority of her songs are about empowering women and just so motivational. I feel like I've always been strong or known my worth, so I was able to relate to her songs. and then other songs are just really fun! no big message or anything, just for fun! NOW LET US BEGINNN

**PART OF ME:** basically about how she's leaving her cheating bf according to the music video and talking about how life and people can be really crappy at times, but you shouldn't let them get the best of you. those people are miserable and sad which is why they try to make YOU sad and miserable. I personally can relate cuz I've been hurt... quite a few times throughout life by many people and honestly find it really hard to trust people now. but no matter how badly they've hurt me, I always, *always* bounce back because I know my worth and know that no matter how much they try to cut me down, they can't. nothing they can say can make me forget myself and my own worth, and I know that truly happy and good people don't try to cut others done or make them feel bad about themselves. whoever does anything like that is NOT truly happy with themselves or their lives. I mean, c'mon. do you really think someone who is perfectly healthy, happy, and good will try to make others miserable? **no.** I also know that if nobody else is there for me, I know I have my family to support me and motivate me. due to these reasons, I absolutely love this song :)

**HOT N COLD:** this one is another motivational song! I loved this song ever since I was little as well because of the empowering message in it. in the music video, Katy is getting married to someone but he gets cold feet. the song is about a toxic relationship, how one person doesn't want the person, but doesn't want the person to want someone else either, or is constantly changing their minds. the relationship started out great but started deteriorating. another thing I really liked was the lyrics that go like 'I should know that you're no good for me' and 'I should know that you're not gonna change'. I liked those because I feel it shows how in toxic relationship, people hardly ever change so it's honestly pointless to stay in those relationships. I know it's easier said than done to leave those relationships, so I'm not shaming anyone for staying in those cuz I know many people try to leave but can't. as I mentioned before, I've always known my worth so this song was motivating for me because when I date in the future, I know that I won't take anybody's crap. I know my worth and know that I deserve to be treated with respect, and I'll treat my S.O with respect, and the minute someone treats me badly or thinks that they can walk all over me, I'm out without a backwards glance. why should I waste my time on someone who doesn't respect me? there are plenty of people out there who will respect me, so I'm not gonna stay hung up on someone who doesn't. k *that* turned into a rant lol, sorry. basically, I found it really motivating and loved the lyrics :)

**LAST FRIDAY NIGHT (TGIF):** i looove this song lol. it's not motivational or anything, it's one of those 'just-for-fun' songs and I sing and dance along every single time. also, her voice sounds amazing in this song lol. i love dancing and the concept of parties, which I unfortunately haven't spent a lot of time at in my short 15 years of life :/ tho I do plan on attending many, many parties as I grow older haha. anyways, the song is just really fun and while the music video is quite crazy lol, I love it regardless and I can't wait till I'm older to have fun and be more independent as I have pretty strict parents who don't let me do a lot of things. that's another reason why I love the song: it gives me hope and makes me excited about the years to come once I get into college and am more independent. to sum that all up, loveee it lol

**CALIFORNIA GURLS:** ok, so this song doesn't have any meaning behind it really either, but I just always loved it ever since I was little... before I understood that the entire song was basically about sex and was full of sexual references O.O I just loved it because I'm from the state the song is about so I felt very proud and famous when I was little cuz the song was about where I lived lol. besides that, I just like the beat and think it's a fun song! :)

k those are all the songs haha. Like I said, I was bored and felt like writing about the songs cuz why not? and also, my family is most likely tired of hearing this gush lol so I'm turning to Internet strangers :) 

k, that is all byee 😁✌🏼",Normal

"I just need to say this. FUCK KOALAS Not literally 

They are the world’s worst animal and they are bad at every. To start instead of evolving to eat normal fucking food they evolved to eat a plant that is poisonous to most animals that has almost no nutritional value. They get so little energy from this plant that they have to sleep 20+ hours a day and when they are away they have to constantly eat or they will die. They also only reproduce through rapeing each other. Also when they are baby’s they drink their mother’s milk which has a decent amount of nutrients. But then they have to stop so they go to eat a poisonous plant. So they eat there parents shit to get used to the toxin(for you nerds I know that it’s not technically their shit but it’s basically the same thing). Also they have not evolved to do what almost all other land animals have learned to do which is drink water. They only learned how because fire fighters gave them water to drink during the wild fires. They also have spinal fluid in their skulls so when they fall out of trees because they forget to hold on. Also they have very small and very smooth brains. They also sometimes die because they forget to hold on to trees.

So that you oner is why I restarted the Australian wild fires.

"Bad luckThis is my first post on Reddit ever. I've had many concussions resulting from different sports and also very bad luck. I can't really complain about the life I had: I had pretty much straight A's in building engineering, I have a large group of friends, my family is very supportive and loving, I have a good relationship with my girlfriend and financially, I'm very at ease. The thing is, I keep getting head injuries in the worst ways possible. I got one 3 months ago and it was my seventh one.after it, I had a period with very dark thoughts, cause it seemed like it was never healing. I love sports more than anything and I couldn't do them. I couldn't even hang out with friends without getting headaches and neck pain. In the last week, it was the first time I actually felt like I was getting better. So much so, I decided to go pick nicking with friends today. When I arrived at the park, I go struck in the head by a frisbee. As dumb as it seems, the impact made me lose consciousness and when I finally got back from my apartment, all my concussion symptoms are back. It just seems that every time it starts getting better, everything just goes back to shit. I don't feel like I have any strength left to go trough recovery once again. University starts tomorrow and I'm so fucking scared that I won't be able to concentraee. I feel helpless, like I'm in an endless cycle and shit goes bad each time I start seeing hope. Almost like life itself wants me to out myself. Sorry for the long post, I just have so much anger rage and sadness",Suicidal

"I'm a broken toyI'm ill, I'm only getting worse, and that's a big problem... for my parents. Because I'm failing college, I've never had a job, and I'm on the verge of another dramatic meltdown like I experienced one year ago to the week or so. 

Panic disorder, social anxiety, agoraphobia... None of these things are just ""being shy."" And none of them are cured by subjecting yourself to more and more exposure. I've had \*no choice\*  but to expose myself for the +6 years that I've lived with these conditions. You \*cannot\* live in the 21st century without having to talk to people. I went through high school, graduated. I went to college, where I am now. I've pushed myself through every single presentation, group project; every class and, now, video conference expected of me. I've pushed myself to appear at the field trips, assemblies, celebrations, that weren't required, but where I knew I was tacitly expected to be. Every week, in and out. You would expect a change?

""Oh just do it, and it'll get easier."" ""You can't heal without putting yourself out there :)""

Last year, October, I had, at my college campus, panic that involved refusing to come home, an active manhunt by campus police to locate me as I ran through woodlands and eventually barricaded myself up on the fourth floor of a main building, where I proceeded to punch through doors, flip tables, scream like a banshee, and almost end up involuntarily committed to a psych ward. How did I avoid the last thing? Well, don't worry... it was only a few months before I actually ended up being held in hospital against my will :D

I know what's wrong with me. I try relentlessly to tell my parents, my extended family, my ""friends"", and even teachers and pure strangers what is going on in my mind. That their \*ideas\* about what will cure me ARE NOT what will cure me. That panics are unstoppable once they're underway, unless I have medicine, which I don't always have.

And they tell me... I'm lazy. That I'm looking for excuses not to be in school. That the money put into my education was wasted. That I'm not committed to my own health. That I'm untrustworthy. That I'm overreacting, that it's ""all in my head.""

What wasn't in my head was growing up abused by my father, walking on eggshells making sure not to trigger him in his irritable Bipolar moods. Growing up beaten for not adhering strictly to rules I had to divine from his head, because I should've known that's what he wanted. What isn't in my head is living with him for my entire life, wary of even looking at him the wrong way, lest I start an argument where things are thrown and I'm kicked out for the +5th time in the past two years. And growing up with a mother who does nothing but invalidate every feeling I have, that isn't blind compliance. Being followed behind and told to basically shut up any time I dare to panic - dare to have a biological event happen that I can't control without medicine, like I said. Being reminded of all the times and all the ways I've failed...

Not having good grades (because I couldn't ask teachers for help because anxiety and panics)

Not attending family get togethers anymore (because I have lost my ability to speak to them because anxiety and panics)

Never acknowledging ""the bright side"" of things, and ignoring ""my blessings"" (because I have reverted to having a toddler's social aptitude because of this fucking disorder).

No, no. I don't want to wait around ""for someone who loves me and cares about me."" I've come across enough people already, if none of them give a shit, what the hell's the point in waiting any longer. I don't want to hear it. I don't want to live anymore. I'm going to do everyone a favor and shut down, I'm the broken toy that disappoints everyone that plays with it.",Suicidal
"Would committing suicide really be THAT bad for your mom?Everyone always talks about how they are skeptical to end their lives because of how devastated their moms would be. I think about this too. But would it really be that terrible for our moms? I read that the way people think about happiness and sadness is not congruent with the reality of happiness and sadness. People think bad situations will make them really sad, and for a really long time (like deaths of loved ones.) People think happy things will make them happy for a really long time (like marriage, children etc.) But really what happens, is people get a sharp increase in happiness when something good happens, and sadness when something bad, and then their emotional states go back to default relatively quickly after that. Hmm. My friend Alf died last month by suicide. His mom was crushed. But she’s much better now, and all of his siblings are much better. Other moms have survived the suicides of their children so why can’t ours.",Suicidal
"""I never thought I'd end up this way. I never thought I'd fall so far away.""
Well...I was asked to make a throwaway and post something here a few days ago...suppose I should.  Just to start off, I am fine now.  However, last weekend I was a bit fed up and just had a lot of stuff hit me at once...and, started wanting out.

In order to get the story, we have to go back...

For about five years now, I have been dealing with the dating world....The longest relationship I have had (2 years) was coming to an end, and I knew it..but wouldn't admit it..was clinging to it...didn't know anything else.  Since then I have dated girls for, oh...a month or two...before they end up cheating, or they just get to be too much too fast.  Two years ago I was working at a local gas station, made a friend of one of the employees, and my life started to change.  Up to this point I had always pretty much been a loner, the ""shy guy""...with this new friend I would do pretty much everything. I would stay there every weekend (we ended up going to another job, working four tens) and we would get drunk as hell.  I loved it, but I hated it....I finally got out of that, and had a falling out with him...then met two other friends...started a band, as I love music, and life was good...wasn't worried so much about dating.....now one has a kid on the way, the other works weird shifts....so back to being a loner....except this time, it is more or less because I hate people.  I have been talking to a girl I met online (not a dating site or anything, just a site similar to facebook)...it turned into more than a freindship, and for the past month we have had plans every weekend.......however, something always comes up and I don't find out until too late....I kinda gave up, and started talking to someone else...she found out, and flipped....now she is pulling the same crap...less talking, blah blah blah...I already know nothing is coming of this.

That is what sparked the feeling/thought.  But essentially, the reasoning is that I really do not see a point in making myself miserable because people in this world are cold, hell...it is making me cold....but coupled with that is the fact that I see the more and more retarded people, milking off people like me who work their ass off for a living....I honestly think economic collapse is coming..and am starting to hope for it....but last weekend I didn't care...I see my dreams falling apart, and I didnt know what to do..was just overwhelmed.  Then I realized, I dont need this shit...The whole reason I am often ""passed up"" is because of my mindset: Don't like a guy with long hair? Don't like my tattoo? Don't like my music? Fuck off, stop judging me. (not assaulting anyone, just trying to tell the story)....Basically, I need to stop with the self pity, and be me..if someone doesn't like it..why do I want to know them?


Anyway..I'll comment if anyone wants elaboration..just wanted to get it off my chest...trying to be more outspoken and stop holding that stuff in.",Suicidal
"Is it worth it?Is it really worth the fight of everyday life for the few sporadic moments of joy? The whole world is going to shit, and the current estimation of how long we have before global collapse over global warming is about 7 years or so. I can’t stop asking myself if sticking around is worth the trouble if everything seems to be pointing towards a dystopian future. I try to stay in the present as much as I can but still. I’m also unemployed atm, and my industry is in shambles. I don’t think I can even have a career in the only thing that I actually enjoy to work in, and to think about working some random job that I don’t despise but don’t love either, fills me with dread, and also, knowing that the human society has made capitalism such an integral part of life makes me sick too. I mean, simply not having a job or not being productive enough is enough for your whole human worth to decrease. You become a lazy ass, or a good for nothing, or a failure. Everything feels slowly more filled with bullshit that nobody cares about but that we can’t escape either. Everywhere I look there’s dumb shallow airhead influencers, or massive publicity campaigns by corporations trying to sell me shit that I don’t need nor want, and the world slowly feels hotter and hotter every year. I don’t want to die, but thinking about what the future holds for all of us makes me think about suicide for real, because I don’t want to live if it means that I have to suffer. Sure, not everything in life is suffering but lest be real, how much joy do we get if we compare it to the bad stuff? It just feels like the bad outweighs the good, and like you have to traverse through a field of shit to reach a small patch of beautiful flowers, and rinse and repeat...


I’ll finish this post with something positive.

I’ll be ok... we’ll all be ok, we’re nearly there, we must keep going, and keep going. Everything will be ok in the end.",Suicidal
I'm done with trying to save myselfI'm 23 years old and I truly don't see me making it to 24.  So far my life has been nothing but letdowns after letdowns. I've never had a job or a honestly a friend so I'm basically living like a 12 year old.  I live with my parents and they treat me like crap and call me a shithead every day. I almost positive I'm depressed because I'm never happy or sad I just feel nothing all the time and I've been like this for so long that I can't imagine life being any other way. Because I literally have zero people in my life I can vent to I decided to do it here. I really really don't want to kill myself but I also really want to just be dead. Every time I in the car I just wish I would get into an accident and die I know that's not normal but it's all I wish for. I spend about 14 hours a day in bed because I just don't have any motivation to do anything. I'm not looking for answers or advice I'm just curious if anyone else out there feels like I do.  Because I hate myself and I just want the mental pain to end. ,Suicidal
"FfsI’m going through that glorious cycle of wanting to kill myself again. Fantasising about every way of doing it. I’m in absolute agony it won’t leave me alone, no medication has helped.

No hopeThere’s nothing worse to me than being told by the one person that I shared my life with that there’s no hope. I ruined everything and every second of this feeling just makes me want to end all of it more and more. Why the fuck can’t I just be normal? Why’d I have to freak out and ruin the only thing that made me feel remotely safe?,Suicidal

"I'm a stone's throw away from giving up.I just can't do it anymore. Every god damned day gets harder and harder and harder.

I'm 21 years old, soon to be turning 22 in October and I feel like I have nothing that really binds me to this world.

Ever since I was 13 I've been depressed, although I wasn't officially diagnosed until I was 14. I remember when I was a kid all I ever wanted was someone to love me. I was awkward, shy and super introverted so I spent more time with my online friends than I ever did with anyone in School.

My dad used to buy my video games when I was still a pre-teen so I could pre-occupy myself while he did drugs, slept for 12 hours a day and then go to ""work"" as a Taxi driver, where in reality he would get in his cab, find a random street, park it there and then go back to sleep, but he'd claim he was at work.

My mom used to hit me when I was younger and because she was young (She was 18 when she had me) and had no one else other than me and my Dad, she used to vent her problems out to me because of course she couldn't to my Dad, and then eventually they divorced, both parents re-married and eventually, my Mom got full custody of me, which was the lesser of 2 evils between my parents. But I was the emotional rag that got yelled at, got hit at for everything minor until I was old enough to stop her from physically assaulting me. 

I remember when I was 14 years old, I'd stay up every night, hold my hands together so tightly it hurt and then prayed to a God. Any god, anyone or anything that was willing to listen to my prayers. I was so delusional to the point that I'd talk to a stuffed animal I had since I was a kid, or I would talk to the Characters on my One Piece poster because seeing that Poster made me think of so many things that I was hoping would come true in my life. ""I can't wait to have Friends like them some day in my life."" Is something I'd think about often. ""No one was born in this world to be alone."" was a quote that had a direct impact on me that I used to fully believe. 

I made up a lie that I convinced myself was true, telling myself that I was adopted and sooner or later my real Mom would come and take me home. Every god damned night I sat there, I prayed as hard as I could all while I had tears streaming down my face and I hoped and hoped and hoped that someone would eventually come take me away.

I watched anime, played video games and read books all so I could escape from reality and pretend I was someone else. Pretend I was somewhere else, where I was happy, where I wasn't so useless.

It's been 7 years since then. No one came to save me.
No one came to take me away. My ""real"" mom doesn't exist.
It's just me, by myself and I feel like even though I've outgrown my fantasies, I can't help but spend hours everyday day dreaming to the point where it feels like I'm addicted to it. I have to daydream to even function. I have to think about a life where I'm somewhere happier, and not in my current state.

By all means, my life isn't even that bad compared to a lot of people so that makes me feel even more guilty. Why am I even depressed?
I work a part time job in retail that I absolutely hate, but it gives me some money to spend on my escapes. 

My family is decently rich, they'll be paying for my College tuition when I start this Fall. Except I know I'm not going to live up to their expectations. I barely passed High School (Through LOTS of help from my Teachers when I got sent to a Learning Centre after I got expelled from Public School for skipping too much because I was too sad to even function in School.) but I lack so much discipline and motivation I can't even go get a haircut. It's been 6 months since my last one.

When I'm at work, even for my short 4 hour shifts, I think of all the different ways that I could painlessly die, whether by suicide or via an accident. The 9 hour shifts are especially bad because I already have a weak physical constitution. I just spiral lower and lower until I'm so drained emotionally and physically that when I get home all I can do is sleep. I'm so desensitized to the thought of suicide that I accidentally brought it up with a co-worker and had to laugh it off while back pedalling real hard.

I don't know, I'm just so tired of living. Every day Suiciding becomes more and more tempting, but I tell myself that I'd rather go see the world then Suicide rather than Suicide in this grief-stricken room of mine seeing the same thing everyday.
My memories become so bad that I can't even remember what I did a few days ago because all the days just blur together.
It feels like just yesterday I was 19 years old, but here I am almost 3 years later.

You know, it's pathetic, but my only escape from life lately has been coming home from work and playing some singleplayer games or watching anime, just like when I was a young teen. I just wish I could still find comfort in some imaginary person who I fully believe would eventually come ""save"" me, just like I did back then. I feel like I've just become cynical and jaded.

But at work, it's like I'm a completely different person. I have smiles on 24/7, I speak with a happy tone, I crack jokes and laugh, until I have to get away for a few minutes at a time because keeping up this fake, happy persona is just so tiring.
I really can't do it anymore. I'm at my wits end.

I'm sorry for the big wall of post. I'm not even sure if any of it's readable or comprehensible, I'm not exactly in the best state of mind. I can't wait to wake up in 3 hours for work and hate myself.
I just want to go to sleep and have an eternal dream that I never wake up from.
I'll even take going to sleep and just not waking up ever again so all this pain and misery could end. 

The only thing I'd miss is not being able to see the ending of One Piece and not being able to listen to Music that makes me feel like I'm in a different world if I close my eyes and imagine hard enough. I'd also miss one of my friends.
I've been so proud of him lately, he's an Artist that's been steadily improving over the years. It finally feels like he's starting to find a purpose in himself and his drawings, and he's finally getting the recognition he deserves. I'm so happy for him. I'm not a big impact in his life whatsoever, so even if I were to disappear I don't think it'd make a difference. 

If anyone read this far, Thank you for taking the time out of your day to listen to some kid on the internet vent about his problems. I have a quote to share with you all that I've held dear to my heart for years and years now.

""People commit suicide because they think they have no other choice, not because they want to die.
Every single human being would rather be happy than dead.
In the end, no one ever really wants to die.""

"Things Didn't Get BetterI posted here back in 2015 or 2016. At the time I was living in old trailer in the woods without plumbing or electricity. My only help and transportation to get food or showers was an abusive family member. I'd pinned everything on getting my driver's license and being able to get a job and then improve my life. 


I of course failed the driver's exam and was banned from further attempts since my state doesn't allow more than 3 attempts.


Today nothing has changed much. I have a job I love but it doesn't pay much but I still can't drive and am helpless and dependent on an abusive relative. They verbally rip me apart and destroy my things. When I stil had to physically go into work they would threaten to withold rides from me, and now that I work from home because of the pandemic, they will make louds calls talking about slurs and rape and things when I'm supposed to be taking calls from customers.


Nothing has changed or gotten better. I'm still helpless and abused. I actually developed a brain mass that damaged my vision. I have carpal tunnel or arthritis and have lost all my hobbies (drawing, gaming) as a result. My abusive relative wastes the money I earn--I pay all our bills, they don't work. My brother, the person I loved most in the world, killed himself a year and a half ago. I feel like it's just an inevitability before the abuse drives me to do the same. 

I did manage to live on my own for a year and a half. And I never managed to make friends, except for one person who would not openly be my friend because ""my ex will think we're sleeping together"". What does it say about me that the only person who would willingly be around me will only do so in secret?

I just cant believe how helpless and easily controlled not being able to drive makes you, and there's basically no one way out if you don't have a supportive family or friends to loan you a car and help you practice. Society doesn't care at all that it's basically condemned people to die or live as helpless victims their entire lives. 

I hate this. And I see no way out.",Suicidal

It hurts to know that everyone that I've ever known can't even notice the bad times that I am going through. And now, this quarantine thing, is just making everything worse. I'm not feeling like ending like this. Alone in a dark room. I want to leave a mark on anything, in anyones life. I feel like no one would notice if I just disapeared. Please, I need to talk to somebody! Please!",Suicidal
"Happy or sad, suicide always seems bestIt was about 9 1/2 years ago that I said ""if I'm not happy with life in 10 years I'm going to kill myself."" I'm getting rather close to my deadline and despite the fact that there are slightly more ""good days"" now than at some points I still have no desire to live.

When I'm happy I just think ""man this would be a good day to end on, everything is going pretty good, and it's definitely gonna go downhill after this."" Then shortly after of course it does, and at that point I enter the more familiar depressive suicidal ideation. And no, that doesn't mean ""it will get better."" It just means that for every month of being depressed I might have a week of reprieve. The reason I set the 10 year timeline was to make sure that it wasn't a fad or a phase, since so many people make that claim.

Unlike a lot of depressed/suicidal people I don't have a lot of the more typical thoughts. I don't feel like ""I can't do anything right"", I don't think that ""nobody cares about me"", I don't think anyone has wronged me, etc. On the contrary I have lots of talents that I feel are going to waste, I have lots of people that care for me which makes the decision to kill myself much more difficult and frustrating, and I have had so many ""blessings"" it seems entitled to throw them away. 

However the modern world and society have absolutely nothing to offer me. There are no jobs that sound marginally appealing, and in fact I've cut back on working so much that I can't even support myself (which adds to my embarrassment/failure). Before when I was working enough, I was so miserable literally 100% of the time that I simply couldn't stand it. Figured it'd be better to be destitute and only sometimes miserable than making decent money and always miserable. I've tried dozens of jobs and quit them anywhere from a few months to a couple years. I see no chance that in 6 months my outlook will change.

What is the point of posting this? I don't know, I guess the same reason anyone else posts. To share my outlook in the hopes that someone else might associate with it. Or maybe someone out there has the exact combination of words to change my mind. Probably not.",Suicidal

Bye."" she replied with, ""I wish you would stop this."" I grabbed my joggers made a knot at the end so it tied together and put it on the door and closed it. I then climbed on a chair and put my joggers twice around my neck and kicked the chair away. My sister was still up and heard the chair so she checked on me.

"I made a list**Reasons not to kill myself**

&gt;My existence improves the lives of family, friends and acquaintances --- even if the improvement is subtle.

&gt; No parent should have to bury their child.

My suicide would cause these people grief. This is the main factor holding me back. On the other hand, this is my life and the feelings of others shouldn't necessarily deter me from ending it given the magnitude of suffering. I won't care about the feelings of those I've been close to after I'm dead.

&gt;The Little Things in Life (TM).

The decision of whether or not to live really comes down to whether or not the sum of my experiences (not the right word, really, but I can't think of the proper substitute) is positive. Sources of small happiness count toward this, too. 

    life.big_things + life.little_things &gt;= 0    

&gt;It's still possible that my net happiness will eventually outweigh my net suffering.

Counterargument to the above. Waiting to see if this turns out to be the case would be the most rational option. I would have plenty of time to experience nothingness after my natural lifespan has expired. However, given the treatment-resistant nature of my depression and anxiety, as well as my family history, it seems unlikely that I'll ever fully recover. 

&gt;I haven't yet listened to all of the music/seen all of the films/read all of the books that I would like to.

On to the section of the list where I rattle off things that I haven't done yet. Of course, these could all be negated by the argument that I won't give a shit after I die.

&gt; I've never created a satisfactory work of art.

Attempts tend to result in frustration rather than catharsis.

&gt; I haven't tried all of the drugs that I'm interested in.

Feel free to judge me. It's kind of sad that this one is on the list, in retrospect.

&gt; I have never been in a romantic relationship lasting longer than a week.

&gt; I have never had sex.

These are, depending on who you ask, major parts of life that I would be missing out on.

&gt; I have never been in a band.

&gt; I haven't fully explored my gender identity yet.

&gt; Though I'm no longer in class, I haven't yet technically graduated from high school.

&gt; It's still possible that a college I would like to attend will accept me.

&gt; I have not had the ""college experience"".

&gt; I have never traveled the world.

&gt; I have not satisfied my desire for knowledge.

&gt; They're making a third season of Twin Peaks.

Again, I can dismiss all of these easily.



**Bonus**

&gt; People will think I've done it over something trivial.

My recent rejection from my top choice college. Or Valentine's Day, which I don't even care about. I won't care what people think if I'm dead, though, so this doesn't really matter.

"Not sure what to do about my futureI'm going to try to not make this post too long because long posts are tedious, but, I really could use at the very least someone relating to my life situation right now.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm currently 16 and i'm a little over halfway through high school, and I really do not know how I am possibly going to graduate. I am failing about 3 out of 7 classes right now, surprisingly passing a few of them, and I failed 3 classes last semester while just barely passing the other ones. Suffice it to say, school is one of the main roots of my severe depression and apathy towards life. I simply cannot get through it. I have skipped so many days this year just because the sheer act of getting up and going to that damn building is just too miserable of a thought, not to mention the homework and all that nonsense. I just can't do it.

My current 'schedule' consists of 1. waking up as late as possible, 2. going to school and just trying to pass the time however I can until I get home so I can sleep, 3. eat too much food, 4. go to sleep and repeat the next day. I don't have any friends and my mom is about as unsupportive as can be (not to get started on my dad but he's not in the picture). She has this aspiration that i WILL and HAVE to go to college but at this point I know I will 100 percent either just kill myself or drop out if I do that. People say they give a shit about you, but that's only when it's convenient or when it makes them feel better about themselves. And the worst part is, I'm the same way. This is a facet of my life that has been a constant goddamn blemish on what little social skills I have. I don't know exactly what it is, but I honestly do not have the ability to empathize with others. I can't relate to anyone's emotions, and I don't feel them like anyone I've ever met. I don't have the mere capacity for regular human empathy, if that makes sense. That's another post in of itself but it's.. it's just shitty.

At this crosspoint, I don't know what I'm going to do. Everything takes too much fucking energy and no one gives a shit about me.

This is sort of related but I am also gay. Have known since I was about 10 and that is also another thing I 100 percent wish I could just delete from myself. I don't really feel 'lonely' as being around other people period is something I avoid at all costs, but, I just know that even if I ever wanted to be in a relationship, my dating pool is drastically smaller. Not to mention I am physically extremely ugly. 

I may get a job this summer, but I don't even know if I'll be able to do that. My only options I can even see at this point are to just a get a job and save up for a van or some shit so I can just live out of that when I evidently don't graduate high school because I'm a massive failure OR just jump into moving traffic because there is no goddamn way I am going to stay living with my mother when high school is or isn't over. Either way, my main goal is to just get away from where I am now because I really, really, really just CRAVE independence. That's about what it all boils down to, I am beyond unhappy with every aspect of my life and I feel like I have no control or angency over fuckall. I want my own money, I want my own place to live, I want a decent group of friends I can be happy hanging out with or something without school or my mom breathing down my neck waiting for my next move.

"How do I offer support to someone who is suicidal while also suicidal myself?I've recently moved in with two of my closest friends and their 2 year old aon. I was in a situation where my mental health was being destroyed and these guys brought me into their family with the warmest embrace I have ever known.

I am suicidal. I have been more often than not in my life. They know this but its not something I like to talk about often nor am I a risk right now.

But I don't know how to handle this next bit appropriately.

See, one of them is also suicidal right now. Heavily abused growing up, he's never quite recovered - he's for the most part suppressed his feelings and worked his ass off like a boss. A total technology wizard. Blows my mind all the time with his creativity and the works.

He's been lashing out at his wife lately. Like, outbursts of emotion - accusing her of not giving him a honest answer because her tone was off, or that she is secretly laughing at him for being stupid.

It is recognizable as projecting and not being able to make certain connections in his mind right now. Both me and her know this.

But I lost my temper the other day as he was berating the most patient woman I have ever seen. I told him that it wasn't okay to speak to her like that. The night progressed and as we know dark spirals do - his words were of despair, self loathing, hopelessness and us being better off if he died. 

And nothing we said brought him peace.

And I probably said all the exact wrong things than suggested when talking to a suicidal person. I was and am at a lost.

I relate to his pain. With therapy I now recognize that those dark truths aren't the only truths for us yet I am also feeling those feelings of self hate and worthlessness. All my words of support feel hallow and untrue and we both know it.

"Starvation : A plan that you can always take backThese are exceptional times. The current situation has changed all of our lives worldwide, and mine is particularly affected. 

I have become stuck away from my home country. I found a job here. I know no one here. I am all alone....

At least this is what I thought. I found someone. They made me feel complete, heard, and cared about. Now, tonight, they have told me that they do not and will never love me. 

I have been in this country for six months, and I must continue to work. 

I have elected to start a starvation regimen. 

As the world slowly eats itself away, so too will I and my relentless recurring act of loving people who cannot love me. 

The beauty of this is that I can always take action. I can change my path. I am in control. Right now, though, I plan for the ultimate self control and determination to give myself some dignity in these last moments.

I sense that many of you are loving people, and I am so proud to know that you exist.",Suicidal

"Despite my life being pretty awesome on the outside, I deeply deeply want to dieThis is my first throwaway. Thank you for listening and please understand that I lead kind of a queer life (you'll see).

I have been terribly depressed since around age 14 (age 20 now), along with some anxiety problems, including a phobia. Though I feel the depression acutely almost every day, I also understand that on the outside my life is awesome: I go to college, have my own place with some friends, am in a great and non-monogamous relationship with a really quality guy (he works with children), and I have a pretty good-paying job in my future field. I have only seriously contemplated suicide a couple of times, and I think the last time was in high school, though I don't remember why.

Two years or so ago, I came out to myself as transgender. Since then, I have been slowly socially transitioning, and the result has mostly been positive and has helped me feel more comfortable with myself. Most of my friends now accept me as a regular guy, including my boss and coworkers. However, the day-to-day grind of feeling deeply uncomfortable with my body really wears me down, and the few reactions of disgust or disapproval, depending on who they come from, can really really really hurt. Just had to deal with this today: a friend who I thought I could trust very politely told me that she is ""conservative about these sorts of things,"" pretty much meaning that she thinks transgender people are somehow ""wrong"" and I am actually devastated. Random strangers being dicks just make me feel disdain, but when friends do it I wonder what other thoughts about my gender people are hiding.

Around October of '12, I began to get sick of my depression. I was bored of letting it define me, disappointed that I often did not have the energy to do my schoolwork, and it hurt my boyfriend's feelings that I slept all the time instead of spending quality time with him. I went to go see a doctor, who prescribed me Zoloft, and I have been taking a relatively low dose since. It helps my anxiety a LOT, but it has barely touched my depression. Recently-ish I fucked up remembering to take it, but it was a catch 22 because my sex drive came back (and the lack thereof had been causing relationship stress). I am back on it again but I'm probably gonna need to go back to the doctor so she can help me experiment more to figure out what's right for me.

This weekend was really hard: my boyfriend was out of town, so on Friday I slept alone which was nice because I sleep like a starfish but also really lonely, and the next night my friend and sometimes lover A slept over, which was very enjoyable. That same night, though, I was forced to deal with my phobia in a big way, and so as not to look bad in front of my lady friend, I chose to try to swallow my multiple panic attacks for the most part. She left in the morning and later in the day Boyfriend came home from his trip, and we immediately got into a huge fight about irrelevant stuff. I guess when I say it like that it doesn't sound very stressful, but this is also on top of housemate drama, a complete lack of energy, new work responsibilities, etc.

For the first time in a very long time, I find myself thinking things like, ""Well, I don't have to do this homework because tomorrow I'll be dead"" or ""I wonder who they're gonna get to do this at work after I'm gone."" Sunday night I was very very serious about curling up in the snow and freezing to death (I live in the most Canadian part of America), but the weather was actually too warm.

To deal with these feelings, I like to get new piercings. I can feel pain in a way that is constructive (instead of just the usual self-harm), I make my body more like I want it to be, and I have something to keep track of and take care of as it heals. I got two new piercings Monday (numbers five and six) and it calmed me down for only like, five hours. So basically it didn't help like it has in the past.

I managed to type this out pretty calmly and everything, but I am so desperate here. I really don't want to hurt the people who love me, but I really really can't go on living. I have absolutely no energy, have been doing the bare minimum in classes (when I even go), and have really been straining my relationships with my constant bouncing between clingy neediness and outbursts. I sleep more than 12 hours on most days, but always feel too completely exhausted to function. After six years with maybe only 3 months total of ""remission,"" I feel completely hopeless about the possibility of ever feeling happy or even normal. Over the 7 years that I've been depressed, I learned some ways of dealing with it, but none of them are working. I'm just totally at a loss of what to do.",Suicidal

"I hate talking about it so much, but I don't know what else.I have so much wrong with me, I'm so alone, and have been like that for so long, my entire life actually. 

The only times people acknowledged was when I had panic attacks, cried, or was on the verge of suicide, and even at those times, barely. 

I have no one to talk to, no one I can trust, I hate talking about myself because it always makes me look like a troll or a beggar or overall a ''bad'' person. 

When I reach a certain condition, I deplete my bank account, and spending money gives me some sort of satisfaction, I don't earn much at all, and my disability prevents me from getting a normal job. 

I know I will kill myself, I know no one will acknowledge me, I know that posting this will only get me judged even more, I don't even know why I'm doing this, maybe I'm desperate for any attention, even if it's negative, never knew much else.

"For those contemplating suicide, and want help. I’m here.I’ve realized now, that it’s important to embrace who you are and what you deal with. For too long i have tried to hide who i really am, and what i really feel, afraid of others looking at me as weak. For years now, i have dealt with serious thoughts of suicide, from a simple lack of motivation to live. Just last week i held a loaded gun to my head, praying for god to give me the strength to shoot. I am saying this to emphasize the point that, mental health is not a joke. It is not easy for someone like me to get up everyday with no real motivation to live. For a long time, i thought i felt this way because of breakups, or financial struggles, but i know now that is not the case. I felt the way i did, because i was afraid to be honest and open. I would sit at home and think about death, then go out in public and pretend nothing was wrong. All the while, making the situation worse. So now i am making an attempt to be open, hoping that this will relieve me of these thoughts, and allow me to be happy again.
Recently my girl friend, my life, my girl... all of a sudden broke up with me. I wasn’t expecting it at all, so it broke me completely. I am the type of person who has never seen value in living for myself, so the thought of losing her, was the same as losing my life. I wasn’t perfect in the relationship, i definitely made serious mistakes. but I loved her. and I thought that together we would conquer the world. This is all i wanted. but when she broke up with me, i felt empty. I felt the same way i did before i met her. I lost my motivation to live. I lost my will to fight, i wanted to die. I tried for weeks and weeks to just make her notice me again, make her love me again, and nothing worked. Nothing i did made her want to be with me again. So i ended up, in my bathroom, Beretta 92fs cocked and loaded, pointed to my head, ready to die. With my finger on the trigger i smiled as i finally felt i would be happy. Then something stopped me. Unable to shoot, i cried until my sister came and took the gun away. The next day, i got up and went to work, pretending to be okay, when a random guy, i had never met before walked up behind me. This guy patted me on the back and said “life is worth living.” 

I’m sorry if my thoughts seemed jumbled but I am still trying to make sense of everything. How does a random guy, come up to me and make such a powerful statement? What made him choose me, out of the 30+ people in the room?

I don’t know, but that one statement saved my life. That one statement is inspiring this message, and inspiring me to live. I haven’t been able to find what i am living for, but i know i have a purpose. So if you happen to be struggling like i am, please know that things will get better. Winter can’t last forever, and Spring is coming. and If you fall, land on your back, because if you can see up, you can get up. Remember that.

So I'm a soon to be 22 year old male and thinking about commiting suicide on my birthday in November. 

There are many reasons I don't want to live anymore but one of the major ones is that I'm so lonely. I have no friends only acquaintances. I had a really good friend from my childhood but we lost contact over the years. I tried to connect with him again but we've grown apart. 

Another big issue I have is that I'm a virgin and I want a girlfriend but it is impossible. I don't think I'm that ugly, I'm tall (6'5) go to the gym regularly and have a normal face. The only thing that I'm not happy about with my body is that I'm starting to loose a bit of hair and that I have acne scars on my back and shoulders.

Also I have tried online dating and that is just painful. I get a few matches but the girls don't want to talk there. I have also tried doing hobbies to meet girls but it never works. And going out to bars and nightclubs is not really my thing. The times I've been to bars and nightclubs I can't help to notice that it's mostly men there like 70% males and 30% females. 

That's another reason, I don't like the political views my country has because we have been taking in more people than we can handle. I recently saw a report about the gender imbalance caused by immigration. And when I was born females to males was 1:1. Now it is almost 20 % more males than females in my age range. That makes it impossible for me to find a girlfriend because I have to compete with all these extra men. And it makes me so sad to think that I will most likely be alone all my life, so why continue? 

Should I just work my entire life and pay taxes so that other people can be happy together and have a family? I don't want to contribute to that. I work a full-time job and was thinking of maybe try to study next semester to get a better job but I can't see how that will change anything.

I have never met my biological father but I know he's still alive. I was raised by my mother who I hate because she have been sheltering me since I was a kid. And that has led to me being socially awkward and unable to connect with people. I don't feel like I belong anywhere. 

I've made a poor suicide attempt before. But this time I have to end it, at least then I will be successful with one thing.",Suicidal
"I’m here to talkHi, I’m Luca, I’ve been dealing with depression since i was 8 years old, I’m still dealing with it, at the age of 18, almost 19, thanks to one of the best person I’ve ever met, I discovered what is my purpose in life, helping people, i love to help, i love to prioritise others over me, that’s why I’m here, to talk, if you need someone to talk to, I’ll be here giving the best support i can possibly offer. I’d like to thank everyone who decides to talk to me about any problem bothering them.",Suicidal
"I feel like shitI have failed at everything I have tried in life ever. Whether it was sports, a decent social life, games, academics. You name it and I've failed at it. I am a disgrace to both society and my family or as my friends call me ""Life less loser"". Academically I am behind 3 years and by the time I finish university all my friends will have good jobs and even my younger siblings will be doing better than me. I just want to be fucking successful I just want one thing just one to go my way, I fucking take my anger out on video games cuz that is the only stupid thing I think I can be good at but spoiler alert im not I fucking suck. 

Ive got no friends who actually give a fuck about my existence who would truly go out of their way to talk to me etc and my family leaves no chance to remind me of how much of a burden and a financial strain I am to the family. All my life I have tried to stay positive through the fucking abuse my dad gave me all my fucking life hoping and imagining that I would have a better future but guess thats not possible with how things are going right now. I have struggled with OCD/Depression for 9 years. 9 fucking years I have suffered and never in those years I felt that I would ever have to even stop and consider for a moment that I would think about ending stuff. I want help but my family is against me taking medical help and going towards meds to help with my OCD. Im sick and I am tired. 

I just want to wake up one day where I dont feel like Im the fucking problem and I have people that are genuinely interested in me and life feels fucking bearable, things seem in control and I am happy. I want to have a career, I want to study and I want to be independent I wanna work hard guys I wanna be successful in life but im too far behind I dont think I can ever comprehend coming back from this Im never going to make it. Im sorry for writing this so vaguely but Im scared of posting in this sub because I dont wanna encourage someone to take the wrong path because for some reason my OCD is convinced im doing just that. I dont mean for this to be encouraging I just want to vent, I cant stop this feeling to fucking end my existence and I dont know who or where to turn to.",Suicidal

"Sometimes it never gets better but try to avoid this before it’s too lateImagine yourself in a situation that you can’t decide which one is easier, keep living in a situation killing you slowly or committing suicide. 
First I’m gonna explain my life. I’m in a country that I’m not a citizen in and because of that I have no rights to stay or to get a job or to do anything. I ran from my own country because I got raped, humiliated, beaten, threatened. My family said I needed to get help from a psychiatrist/psychologist or whatever and I needed to be cured because of being gay. Nobody gave me a job, my family didn’t support me emotionally or financially, once police officers came to my home because neighbors complained about me being gay, I got beaten by some people four times, my cousin and my brother abused me dozens of times when I was kid, I got kicked off from some restaurants, hairdressers, markets many times, got raped three times, and so on. So that’s why I came to this other country and I asked for help, I went to many organizations, I talked with many people. Nobody can do anything right now and I try to survive by doing some things that I don’t wanna do. I slept with guys to eat and stay with them. And now I can’t do it because of some reasons. There is an organization and they told me they can help me in 2 months, but I only have one week to stay in the place that I’m staying and also I have no money. I don’t have anything atm except my phone and some clothes. I sold my other stuff to buy some medicines and food. I was saying “at least I’m alive and nobody is telling me I need to kill myself”. It didn’t last long. I just wanna die and escape from everything but I am not dying... I am thinking of killing myself but I’m afraid to do it and I don’t wanna suffer while I’m dying. I just wanna die instantly. But it’s not happening. People say I should think about the things what I got or killing myself is not a solution. I don’t want a solution, I just wanna relieve and get rid of all these things. And also I don’t have anything to lose. No family, no friends, no job, no money. Anything. I don’t even have hope. What’s gonna happen? Am I gonna find my place in this world and people who’re gonna be my family? Maybe, but I just have one week to find these. So I’m waiting for a miracle. Anyways, I’m writing this because I know there are a lot of people like me, even worse, but if you’re reading this and if your life is getting worse, please try to find help and hope. I wasn’t expecting to be in this situation, but here we are. Always try to have backup plans, never forget that everything is possible. Even I can’t believe that I’m living this. Just be happy and make plans, if they don’t happen, make another one. Live the moment but never forget yoir future. There are millions of good people, I couldn’t find one because I didn’t have enough time and couldn’t search enough. But you have time, please find them! Everything is gonna be fine, you’ll be fine.",Suicidal
"Back again today with the thought of putting a plastic bag over my head, gone.I'm definitely going to shoot myself in the heart. I feel this is going to give me the cleanest death (emotionally) I can feel. 


Everyone says it's not going to be successful. I sure hope not. Its gonna suck if I'm paralyzed. But I'd prefer to be paralyzed than physically tormenting my own body and my cats. I first though abouts suicide when I was 11 or so about 20 years ago and it hasn't left my thoughts. EVERY DAY. This is all I think about EVERY DAY.


Yesterday I came here wondering any philosophy behind suicide. I STARTED feeling a little better after I deleted my post but my cat started infuriating me and I smacked her a bunch and spent the rest of the day in bed. I'm up today feeling my options, which I've known since I was a child. Any ideas you guys have would be great.

I text a few friends so somebody knew where I was as I had no intention of leaving my phone on whilst I cleared my head. Next thing I know I get an influx of loving and supportive messages. 

These people care about me. These people have been sat there watching me destroy myself and never once turned their back on me. Some of them I’ve hurt and let down. I got so caught up on who wasn’t in my life and the traumas I’d been through that I completely forgot about who is there.

"I feel like I'm a toxic poison to my familyI've been depressed since childhood. I'm seeing a psychologist but I feel like all I do is cost my parents money for that.

If I go now while he is still young maybe I won't fuck him up. I don't even know why my husband married me.
I've wanted to die since I was a young teenager and people keep stopping me. I'm scared to do it though. I just spent a half hour looking at ways to kill yourself on a different subreddit.

"Nothing is working and i'm sliding back down.The more I think about things the more depressed I get and the more I consider suicide - or at least disappearing and living totally off grid - a viable option. The future is uncertain, bleak and terrifying and I can't see a way out.

"I think I am going to kill myself tomorrow.Tomorrow the winter break will be over and everyone in my house will go back to school/work, so I will be home alone for 7 hours (I dont go to school anymore). During that time frame I could kill myself. I know how to do it. I have everything I need to exit this life.

I will write a note detailing what to do in the event of me ""surviving"" and entering a coma (you can guess what I would want them to do). I have a journal in which I will write my final words and thoughts. I will leave a message in that journal for everyone I love and care about, and my parents. I have a lot of writing to do between now and tomorrow because I want this to be done well, I really care about these people. I will also probably make one last post on this subreddit, thanking everyone who tried to help me. 

I am still hesitant though, my mood swings so much I dont know what is real. It's difficult because I haven't been diagnosed with any kind of mood disorder so I dont think I am getting the proper support. What I do know is, I hate who I am and I know that I will never be the person I want to be. I am so unhappy and anxious. Sometimes I'm euphoric but those moments are short and fake. Everything I do reminds me how much I hate myself, even seeing my hands or hearing my voice. Sometimes I like the way my voice sounds, and sometimes I also find myself very attractive and I feel happy during those times, but I know those feelings are unrealistic. I see myself die everytime I close my eyes.

I would appreciate anything at this point. I dont feel comfortable talking about this kind of stuff with people that I know in real life. I'm sorry for rambling a bit near the end; I am still putting the peices together in my head and it doesn't make a lot of sense to me either.",Suicidal
"LethargicI just had a positive life changing moment. I should be ecstatic right now and feel like I can conquer the world.

But....

I don't feel like that at all. Am I happy? Yeah, but every negative moment leading up to this has made me unbearably depressed. The therapy meetings, doctor appointments,arguments, deaths, medications, and losing friends. 

It wore me down to the person I am now.

My life changing moment isn't to blame for this because I realize its the feeling of loneliness, worthlessness, failure, and self hatred.

 It's just me.

It never goes away...no matter what happens, who I am with, or what I accomplish. I am always trying to find the source of my problem but honestly it's just how I am. I don't think it will,ever go away.

I'm at this point where I don't want live like this. 

What do I live for?
If I am not living for myself why am I alive?
For the sake of just existing?

Are there people who care for me?
Sure, when they feel like it.

I juggle around with the thought of dying in my head a lot. I think I'm crazy and often wonder if I should be in psych ward or something but I hear those places are essentially a prison.

My living situation is toxic and I don't have the means nor mental stability to get myself out.

My support system is a fucking joke but its my fault for trusting others.

"I thought I had my way out but now I have nothingYesterday my mother took me to the doctor and I was prescribed Amitriptyline. I didn’t know what it was but as soon as I looked it up I felt like I finally had an opportunity. A couple of google searches showed it can be fatal. I’ve been looking for a way to die for a while and this is the first time I think I’ve finally found something that can let me leave in peace.

I thought about slitting my wrists, but I don’t want to do that. It’s pain and mess and it barely works. I’ve gone through enough shit as it is. I don’t feel like useless physical pain, an ICU visit, and ruining my life from endless judgement and being treated like shit the way suicidal people often are. So I ruled that one out.

I thought about hanging myself from my ceiling fan. I was going to do it with a sheet. Heard about how you can shit yourself doing it, or fall and break some bones so those were negatives. But again I need something. I just want to leave. Put a ladder up to the fan and realize it’s wobbly and weak. If I hang my fat ass from it, the whole ceiling will probably cave in. Great. Another one of the list.

All the research/googling/whateverthefuck I’ve done has shown that the best way to do it is to shoot yourself in the head. That’s great. Really fantastic. I’m not old enough to buy a gun, and if I was, I don’t have buy a gun money. I could steal from my mother but I’d rather not. Great option. Off the list.

The Amitriptyline was like a saving grace. I swear. I thought, finally. Finally. I have a way to fucking leave in peace. Take all of them and just go the fuck away. For ONCE. Of course, I had to do some research to be sure. I really need to stop researching, because the researching is what really fucks me over. Found out it can be lethal. Great! Now to know how much to take. Turns out, it’s an amount way above what I was prescribed. On TOP of that, endless stories of people taking a fuckton, yet still waking up in an ICU condemned to an earthly hell. Fantastic.

I really just want a way to leave. That’s all I’m asking for. I don’t want a lot. Just to fucking LEAVE. The universe has made it clear that it doesn’t want me here. People make it clear they could give a fuck about whether I’m here or not. That’s fine. But if that’s the case, it shouldn’t be so hard for me to just fucking kill myself. It shouldn’t.

I don’t do well with empty platitudes. If anyone really wants to help me, just let me know where the exit is. Greatly appreciated.",Suicidal
"Need adviceI’m seeing psychiatrist/psychologist next week for the first time ever. I am going to be as honest as possible with them about my suicidal thoughts and everything.

"Some days are good, most days I don't want to be here any more.Recently I've fallen in love, the situation is extremely difficult and confusing and I'm unsure how to handle everything. I know how I feel and how she feels but it doesn't make a difference on me feeling unable to handle everyday life.

It's as though I'm stuck in a place where I try to better myself not for other people but to be a better me. Non of it matters though, no matter how hard I try to be the best me I can so that I am happy nothing changes. On a day to day basis the thought of suicide crosses my mind so many times I'm unsure how to handle it all anymore.

Whether it be a gun, overdose, crashing into a object at speeds I know will end all the pain. I don't want to be here any longer and I'm not sure what to do anymore.

The sad thing is I know she loves me. And she isn't the reason I'm feeling this but I'm scared because how can someone I see as perfect see me as perfect aswell when all I see in myself is disgust and hate. I've never known how to love myself but I've been able to love others so much I get lost in what seems like an endless void. I'd do anything for so many people but can't do anything to help myself and it's the most terrifying thing I've experienced, there has been so much pain and sorrow in my life in the past and I've tried forgiving and moving on but daily I think of the past and the terrible things that have happened.

"First time I've thought like this, but seriously thinking it.Posted in r/depression, but stumbled upon this area. Seriously thinking about committing suicide because of how worthless I feel. Never in my 18 years, and hopefully 19 soon, have I ever thought this. At first I considered getting into alcohol or drugs (which I'm huge against), but then it finally grew into suicidal thoughts. 

Here's just some things that are really pushing my depression/thoughts:

First, the love of my life, or what I seriously thought was, finally told me that we can't be together, ever. 

Second, my family and I have been getting into it about financial issues and how working a volunteer position right now isn't helping. 

Third, I feel ashamed for having a friend that I seriously care about, break down on me because I told her I'm having these thoughts. It's gotten to the point where it seems as if she doesn't want to talk to me now.

And lastly, I keep having these visions of me eating a gun that is in my house, or staring at a belt to hang myself with. I'm scared that I'm having these thoughts, and it makes me sick to even know that I am, but I'm seriously considering it since I'm a worthless piece of shit to people. I feel that even the littlest thing will push me over the edge.

"Burnt outUnmotivated to do anything at all. Jerking off would be too much trouble. Walking to the fridge would be too much trouble. Getting up to piss would be too much trouble. 

So obviously I'm not wanting to kill myself right at this very second. But for the past few years it's been on and off pretty consistently. I don't know how many times the 'three day rule' saved me. 


The first time I ever really wanted to do it, I wanted to get off a bus to jump off a tall structure nearby. I was 17. But I didn't. I was reading a book on the bus and even though I didn't care about anything, I kinda cared about how the book ended. A few months later, I was hiding in a public garden near there, making out with someone I'd recently met, and I looked at that tall structure for a moment and thought ""I'm glad I didn't do that; this is pretty great."" 


The next serious moment was over a year after that. It was a couple days after I opened pandora's box and realized I am transgender. I've never been transphobic, but the revelation was too much for me on top of everything else. I can't talk about it. I had one foot in the land of the dead.  


There were a few bleak moments in the couple years after that. Actually a few months ago, I was on the subway headed wherever. Plan was to get smashed and then maybe do some more hard thinking about if it was all worth it. But this crackhead sat down next to me and started telling me why the English language is the devil (fair enough really, but I didn't want to hear about it). I wanted to get away from him, so I got off at the next stop. And a few minutes later, I ran into a buddy and ended up just shooting the shit with her over coffee for a couple hours. And later I thought, damn- that crackhead on the train really did me a solid. What were the odds of me getting off the train at the exact right time, at the right stop, to run into one of the few people I would have been willing to interact with? I live in a large city. I don't believe in god or fate or anything- but if I did, I'd think someone upstairs sent ""English is the devil"" guy my way. 


And today I feel completely drained. You know the drill. Nothing seems worth it. I don't care about anything, except for a few people. The best thing is to not forget about them; depression can make you forget. But hey, writing this thing energized me enough to walk to the fridge. So there's a bit more life in me than there was 10 minutes ago. I wish I had some tranqs, but then again I don't know if I could get more sedated than I already am. 


I don't want to go into specifics, in case someone I know sees this. But I'd have to say the main cause of my depression is that I'm so uncomfortable with myself, mostly due to being closet trans but also due to other things. Then there's also external factors, like people being stupid and the future seeming really bleak. But fuck, I'm so far down the hole. I don't remember what it's like to not be depressed. I'm not even sure if I want to be not depressed. If I wasn't depressed, I'd care more about stuff. Fuck that. How would I get by at all if I cared more? 


I'm a bit drunk now so one more story. Like two weeks after that time I didn't want to talk about, I called someone I trust and told her about it. She said she wanted to call the cops. I didn't want her to do that, and plus I had work, so I told her that if she didn't, I'd call a crisis hotline and tell them everything, and if they told me to go to the hospital, I would. And I guess I could've just lied, but I was good to my word and called them. They told me they didn't think I was a danger to myself anymore, so I called the person I'd told and reported back to her. She believed that I'd called them- maybe not the best thing to do, but since I really had, it worked out. Her memories of that summer are totally fucked, so I don't know if she remembers any of it now. Part of me wants to ask. 


I have to get out of bed now. I can see my tits and my big lady hips from the position I'm lying in, and I care just enough to not want to look at that. Which is more than I cared about anything twenty minutes ago- so maybe there's hope for me yet. ",Suicidal

I kept quiet, did what I had to do with finesse and i was efficient in almost all aspects of my life but I now think I'm at the point of burnout (been 2 weeks now). I can't deal with life anymore. I'm done. Finished. 

For context and I know it sounds stupid but some chick earlier this afternoon (a little older than me or I think around my age) was with her mom and her little kids. At my shit job, I started saying hi smiling and she smiled back but murmured and had a little mocking grin facing her mom. I felt a little out of my element and was less energetic and I started feeling a little gloomy. The chick then left the store running and laughing with her mom. I had this happen to me with two chicks who I gave Halloween candy to back in the 11th grade and they just looked at me and started running off and laughing. The fucked up part is that she's not an ugly chick. She's actually decent looking.

This is the shit I have to live through. I just came back from my shit seasonal job at Amazon and got to the other store (my other job) right after that. I was actually feeling OK but then I thought about all of the shit I had to endure for the whole waking up at fucking 5:45 am to get to my first shit job of the day. Fuck that.

The reason why this is fucking with me is because a few chicks used to make fun of me back in high school and it still continues to this day. What's the point of living if every single move is in anticipation of being ridiculed and mocked. Then people who live in their own bubbles (like my manager ) who I'm cool with tell me to get over it even though I listen to all his girl problems he has on Tinder and try to offer solutions and listen to him. I don't get shit on Tinder so yeah, I can't relate bro.

I'm just tired in general. Just tired of constantly being reminded of my ""responsibilities"" from my dad and just tired of the BS from everyone. The best part is I have no one (except a former mentor) of mine in high school to talk to about this shit I'm dealing with and I haven't spoken to him in 5 years. My friends which I have none at the moment because I text them and they don't want anything to do with me judging by their non replies.

 And I will not tell my parents my suicidal attempts/thoughts. They won't understand. Plus being a black man fucking makes this shit all that more great.

I'm done with a passion and I think I'm at the point of no return. I'm a 5 minute walk away from an interstate overpass so I'm good to go. Fuck life.

I'll probably have to go to my shit Amazon job tomorrow and then rinse and repeat until I go through with my plan around this week. I've tried everything except for full fledged therapy and taking a vacation or leaving my area for a few days. I've tried positive thinking, exercising. But it all seems for naught since I'll be faced with another setback as I'm always faced with. It's like everything good I do ends up turning to shit. What's the point.

"20 year old U.S male, planning second attempt. going to make sure it happens this time.i have a lot to say but it doesn't matter. i'll give some examples of how people in my life treat me and how it makes me feel. no incel stuff here, i'm more well off than others financially, intellectually and physically.

you know in American Psycho when Bateman breaks up with his date and says ""i have homicidal thoughts that cannot be corrected""? it's like that. this cannot fucking be fixed and i'm sick and god damn fucking tired of trying and doing the same bullshit every day, tired of holding a fucking knife to my neck to stop thinking of suicide, tired of fucking hating every worthless second.

i just fucking hate every waking moment of every day. the only thing i enjoy is sleep and i got 2 hours of that before work today. god it just fucking HURTS. i'm anxious all day every day about fucking everything. and i've been taking care of myself - i've been taking lexapro every day like i should, working out 6 days a week, eating right, getting re-enrolled, going to therapy. it's not fucking working and i feel even worse than i did during my first attempt. for the first time in 3-4 years i've actually tried, and i've been better and corrected behaviors, and i feel fucking worse than i did when i was smoking pot, skipping class and playing video games all day

i've been taking care of myself but nobody gives a fuck about me. the 3rd girl i've ever loved gave me the most intimate experience of my life, a week later professed her love for me at a party she came to with her boyfriend, and the next day told me over the phone she doesn't feel anything for me. this was last week. we knew eachother for 4 fucking years and this is how our beautiful adventure ends.

i've been talking to this girl for 2 months that i like sort of. we've been on dates and made out and she was my v-day kiss. we work nearby so i saw her for like 30 mins when her store was dead, i went and got breakfast for her and we make plans to go to her place tonight. now it's ""oh sorry me and my friend just made plans, oh and i forgot that other girl is staying the night"". i canceled going to a fucking concert with my brother and his best friend for her to do this again. if you don't like me, just tell me you don't fucking like me so i don't have to hate myself. you don't have to sugar coat it, you talk to me one way but treat me another, just fucking say it and i'll fuck off if that's what you want.

here, okay, this is the best one. my best friend. my best friend is a girl i've been close with for 5 years. that's a quarter of my life. i just got out of a 4+ year abusive relationship with my ex and i'm finally, after years of this happening and months of us being separated, telling my BEST FRIEND about the verbal, physical, and sexual abuse. her reaction? ""oh wow. Jaiden did that? Wow! I can totally see that."" fucking nothing! ""I... can't keep it to myself anymore. I was sexually abused for a really long time."" ""daaaamn Anon wow!"" 

we're talking about something deep yesterday and i finally reveal to her, after a year of it killing me inside and no one knowing, i attempted suicide. and she literally just fucking ignored it.

i'm a normal fucking guy and i've been taking care of myself. i was a recluse for so long and these past few months i've been saying fuck it, i'll fight through the anxiety and paranoia and i'll do it. i'll be healthy. i get a job, get things sorted out with school, i lose 10 pounds and regain a lot of lost muscle, play guitar and sing like i used to, and i just feel fucking worse. and i TRY to have these relationships and it just makes it worse.

i'm not an asshole, i'm not annoying or unfunny, i'm a normal, intelligent, attractive guy who gives a fuck about shit and takes care of himself. but no one cares about me. you know that song ""Behind Blue Eyes"" by The Who that Limp Bizkit shat all over? that's me.

i'd rather just go back to being alone, because at least i had control. i'd rather be an addict or an alcoholic. i'm fucking tired. i feel like shit every day and realize no one loves me or will ever love me. there's just something wrong deep down inside, and i just wasn't meant to be here.

this is the perfect time of year for this actually. that song ""That's Life"" by Frank Sinatra - the message and the chronology. he keeps trying and trying and if he never wins then it wasn't meant to be, ""if there's nothing shaking this here come July, I'm gonna roll myself up in a big ball and die"".

i turn 21 July 1st. if things don't change by then... if they just get worse like they keep doing... i'm doing it this time, and i'm fucking doing it for real. no pills and alcohol. i'm going to make it work.

fuck it i hate fucking being here i don't want to live and i never fucking asked to",Suicidal
"Really just looking for some supportMy husband has had strange seizure-like spells in the middle of the night for the last year, every 3-6 months, still not sure what the cause is after multiple doctors appointments. He's been fine afterwards but they're terrifying when they happen. I sense one coming tonight and I'm having so much trouble dealing with it. Really, I can't handle it right now. My heart is pounding out of my chest, I feel like I'm dying just from the worry that it's going to happen and I'll be all alone. So alone. He's my support in life, he cures my anxiety when I'm with him but only when he's conscious.  Not when he's limp or twitching with his eyes rolled back in his head. I have no one else for support in this. No one gets it, I need to grow up. I'm just looking for someone to ride it out with, even just on spirit.",Suicidal
"I can't take it anymoreIt just seems like my life is in deep black abyss of suffering and hopelessness. I've never felt so alone. It keeps getting worse and worse. ""It Gets Better"" doesn't seem to apply to me. It's so hard not break out into tears on a day to day basis. I'm autistic. I can't even look anyone in the eyes. It's too painful, it feels like I'm starring into the sun. I'm always starring into the ground when I walk. And when I look up my eyes automatically lock onto someone else's eye, I can't control it. And then I just automatically look away in sheepish shame, my eyes can't help but flicker away. I wish I could read body language. I wish I could know what someone was thinking or feeling just by looking at them. I wish I could just talk to someone and exchange our views and ideas about things. I want to know what other people have to say about things. I know what I should say but my brain won't allow me to say it. I feel like my brain is a prison and that my mind is in solitary confinement. I feel like my heart is being brutally stabbed and that blood just keeps flowing into it without purpose. The pain is too great for me to bear anymore. My poor neurotic mind is tearing itself apart. 

It hurts that I'm so good looking and yet so insecure and lacking in confidence because of my broken mind, It's almost like some divine being gave me good physical genetics and inferior mental genetics as a good laugh laugh. I guess the guy upstairs has an ironic sense of humor. I didn't always used to be like this. I used to not have an Asperger's diagnosis, people liked me and thought I was funny, I was confident and sure of myself. I used to always know my life would be perfect, or at least I thought it would be. Now I'm the complete opposite, I'm anxious and ashamed of myself. I thought about stabbing myself in the leg earlier just to feel, I punched myself in the ribcage repeatably instead, that way if I ever escape my suffering I won't have a physical reminder of my sins. I just wish I could speak to Kenzie while being able to look into her eyes. She's so beautiful, it's like her blonde hair was made from sunshine. I know she at least likes me. She has hinted at me twice to take her to Homecoming before. One day she even asked me if I was OK. I wasn't but I said I was anyway. No one ever did that before, she made my day and the rest of my year. If I told her some of the things I was telling now I know she would at least listen. She's no stranger to anxiety or depression either. She's kinder than most people. 

Most of my ""friends"" are mean to me and put me down and make fun of me. I hate them. One of them constantly calls me stupid, I think he's mean because he's jealous of my good looks and the attention I get from them. It's just too bad I'm too useless to get anything with my looks, too autistic. I feel like I'm a waste of space, I feel like I contaminate the oxygen in the air. My school would hate it if I killed myself, too many people kill themselves already. The school has a bad reputation for suicide. A girl that always liked me tried to kill herself with blood pressure meds recently, I want to talk to her about it when she comes back but I don't know how. I probably won't as it would feel to rigid and awkward to get past small talk. I could just say what I want to say but I don't know that would go over. I feel like if people don't respond to me positively my brain registers it as negative, I hate myself. I wish I could remember an inspirational quote about overcoming my circumstances but my memory is so bad it won't allow me too. I feel like that guy in the Metallica sone One. I either have to bullshit, cheat, or cram to get sufficient grades and I hate it. I hate that I have no coherence in my sentence pattern. My attention is horrid also, I can't even read a book. I wish I could at least read a book. I think I might try drugs one day, that way I'll feel the warm sunshine upon my life temporarily and not the cold, black endless suffering. 

There's a shotgun in my house if I ever need it. I might have to use it soon, I hope not though. I can't tell my Psychologist this or else I would be institutionalized because I have an easy access to firearms and know exactly where I'm going to pull the trigger in my neighborhood. Not sure if I will write a note or send people individual messages or neither. If anyone is open to talking I would like to try it, maybe someone would listen to me and try to understand.",Suicidal
"Had depression for years, it always comes back, I'm here because I'm sitting in front of a pack of strong benzos and thinking of taking them.First signs appeared when I was 8 or 9, stuff got worse ever since, spent five weeks in a mental hospital when I was 12, depression sometimes takes breaks that last for a few months, usually after a year or two of therapy. I have tried killing myself multiple times, I fail because the rope breaks or the pills end up not being lethal, even though I sleep for 22 hours straight from half of one of those. I'm tired of everything and I know that depression will keep butt fucking me for years, because not only does my dad have it, but my brother had it, as well as my grandfather. I'm sick of everything, especially people because most people care only when I'm suicidal and ignore me when I'm not.

"Social anxiety is ruining my lifeLife could be great for me. I'm young, I could be everything I want to be. I could have friends. 
But I have social anxiety. Which means every day I wake up and I'm terrified because I'll have to go to school. Which means I will never be able to pursue the career I want because I won't get into university with my grades being pulled down by oral marks and even if I do, how could I ever be a psychologist when I am afraid to talk to people? Which means that I will be stuck in my unhappy relationship forever because he's my only friend and I am absolutely terrified of being alone. 
I just don't want to be like this. Social anxiety isn't just shyness, it's awkwardness, A lot of it. And I hate myself for being this way, so, so much but I can't change. I've been wanting to die for 4 years. I can't face another fucking day at school being the weirdo, I just can't. I'm so done. So fucking done. But I'm too much of a coward to go through with this.

Life is just a chore that drones by way too fast some days and way too slow others.  One thing always remains the same - it's all pointless.  Nothing can be done.  Nothing can be accomplished.  Always a reason I can't do things.  Must be nice to be born into a family that actually gives a shit about you, has the finances to make sure you have a shot at a real life, has parents actually around to teach you things.  must be real nice.  I can only fantasize about what life might have been had I been born into a real and worthwhile situation instead of being some kids' bad mistake.

fucking...26 now, and nothing is worth anything.  Nothing is interesting.  Nothing is fun.  Nothing is clever.  Everything is boring.  There's nothing remotely interesting to do.  I have a dying creative side that I can't do anything with because I don't have the money to do anything with it.  I also don't have any talents.

Eventually I'm just going to die and not exist anymore - rendering absolutely anything I could have done pointless anyway.  What's the point to live just to die?  I don't understand religious people - it's so fucking obvious and blatant that we're just some shit organism that grew on a rock and will cease to exist like everything else.  How the fuck are people so stupid that they'll believe in magic and fairy tales in which they don't even have evidence for?  All that shit does is make the time we do have worse.

I'm angry at everything, all the time.  Everything annoys me.  Nothing is pleasurable.  I eat begrudgeonly when my body won't stop demanding it.  It's expensive and feels like shit going through me.

run the fucking retardrace in hopes that some wealthy fucking fuck will throw you a pittance and call you a good boy so that you can eat and live another day just to waste it all at his fucking whim.  Hey, it's his kid's futures you're working so hard for, isn't it?  They need to know what a life without conflict or work or problems are.  Fucking rich pieces of privileged shit.

Unfortunately I couldn't even be born a gender seen worthwhile in humanity's eyes.  Nobody likes a man.  A man is scary, dangerous, creepy, gross, expendable, trash, a lapdog for women.    Fodder for the women and children and the wealthy.  Fight and die in wars they start so they can live happy and without conflict.  Fuck them. fuck people.  fuck all people.  why should i give a fuck about anyone anymore?

There's only one thing left i want to do, and that's to die fucking gloriously.  i'm going to drink until i can barely stand, on a rooftop, and shoot my fucking brains off while fireworks shoot from my body.  Maybe I'll crush some asshole on the way down.",Suicidal

"how do i make a blade sharperi made this throw away account out of desperation you could say. ive been struggling with suicidal thoughts since my pre teen years and attempted 2 or 3 times thru my adolescence (my memory is fuzzy and ive struggled with a lot of fucked up symptons probably due trauma and whatnot plus i think i repressed a lot of traumatic memories so my memory is even worse). and ive been planning on attempting again for a while now. very few things keep me away from attempting, one of these things being self harm. i know its not healthy but my blade is dull (its a pencil sharperner blade, ive been looking into buying an actual razor blade but pandemic and quarentine came around) and i really really dont have any other option here. therapy is out of the question given my current situation and confinding in friends is also not an option. so if you have any advice onto how to sharpen a pencil sharpener blade thatd be nice. since its one of the few things that keep me ""in line"" if that makes sense.

(sidenote: no i cant buy another pencil sharpener. i started cutting at a young age and attempted suicide also at a young age so my family strictly forbids me getting my hands on anything that i might possibly harm myself with. that doesnt mean that theyre great or caring btw but i wont get into my life story in this post. anyways yeah just give me advice on how to make it sharp again)

All my life I've grown up with nothing, my family has been poor and it's because of the government. That's why I started extorting females to send me nudes. What's the point of living anymore. I'm going to leave this planet with a bang. I hope to see my name on the news. "" Adam Jacob Lopez kills 25 bystanders in local mall"". It's funny because you'll never catch me hahahaha! I already have everything planned out. I have a hand gun in my bag and a few rifles already securely placed around my local mall ready for me to pick up when I get there on Christmas day. If you wish not to be killed, don't go to any malls on Christmas day. and I don't mean inside them, I mean near them. I'll be waiting for you all :) If somehow police officers discover me earlier than I anticipated I will blow my brains out live on twitch ready for my fans to see.",Suicidal
"I Honestly Need HelpIve gotten to the point that I'm looking up methods of suicide to find the one that would hurt the least for me. For details, I'm a 25 year old junior in college still trying to get my undergrad. As of two months ago I quit a heavy daily weed use habit and am struggling against addiction with alcohol too. I've realized yesterday I've lost all my friends as they all moved on to finding new ones and left me reaching out to no response. I can't meet new people because after trying to connect in a conversation, the next day they pretend I'm not there even after a flowing convo for a bit. At this point I'm already heavily medicated by my psychiatrist and the changes they've been making are having no improvement. I've read the best method for ending it is overdose and I'm nearly 50/50 on the idea of doing it at this point. Has anyone ever come back from the brink like this?",Suicidal
"I want to give upI'm a burden to literally everyone in my life. Everyone would be better off without me. 

My mental health is fucked. It always has been. It's so fucking tiring struggling through every single day and making progress little by little just to fucking break down again. 

I'm so disappointed in myself. I'm ashamed. I hate myself. I wish I wasn't here to witness how much of a fuck up I am and see everyone around me either trying to help me at their detriment or hating me. 

Last time I almost killed myself was 6 years ago, and I didn't because I lived alone and my cat needed me. 

Tonight I know my cat lives with me and my boyfriend, and both of them probably prefer each others company to mine. 

No one needs me. No one's life is improved by me being in it. 

After 6 years I have self harmed tonight. I want to end it. I don't want to do this anymore. I'm such a shitty person I'm not worth it.",Suicidal
"I dont want to be here anymore.Everything I do is meaningless or subpar.

My family (particularly my mother. R/raisedbynarcissists material) only care anecdotally. All that anyone does is yell and swear at me. I can never sleep. I was thrown out of my mothers house by her landlord and had to move back to town.

Dad says a man gets a job and theres no geographical solution to an emotional problem (in other words he quotes the fucking Sopranos)

I've been hospitalized twice. I'm covered in scars. I'm fucking sick and nobody will help me. 

My only release is 3 hours a day on the weekend when I get to train wrestling in a frigid room. I have four weeks left of that training and then work is going to steal all my free time and the wrestling shows will be gone. 

It was the only thing that gave me life again. I traveled from Newfoundland, Nova Scotia, New Brunswick helping at shows for free and fucking loved every moment.

Now I work this nightmare bullshit job as a pissant rent a cop over 2 hours away from my home by bus and soon that job will take my training from me. 

Next week I have to work 3 to 11 over 2 hours away by bus. Buses shutdown at midnight. 

So I'm going to get trapped on the other side of town.

I started this line of work at 19 and worked for one company for six years. I was hardworking and diligent and made minimum wage the whole time. No raises. No praise. Nothing.

Then I witnessed someone shove a knife through their face and burned out. Shared a news story about then company and got blacklisted. Company claimed we were family. 

Their Corporate funded EAP therapist said in response to the death I witness that nicotine is bad for me and I should stop smoking as that is raising my stress levels. Thanks boomer.

Got hospitalized on my birthday 2019 Therapist on staff suggested BPD, or maybe MDD, or maybe C-PTSD 

(they dunno knows. My family dr says it's all nonsense and nobody knows what meds to try, im sick of taking pills and ""let's just see what happens"" my wait list is two years for diagnostic testing)

And if I have these disorders I would rather be dead.

A year ago I had a home and was in college despite not having any full time work. My ex threw me on the street for not wanting to have children. I burned throughly savings on hotels and planes, flew to Newfoundland and spent a couple months there. 

but my aunt sent me home for being shitty at lawn maintenance.  (Old style newfie. ""I dont believe in this depression nonsense"")

I came home to my moms until her landlord got nosey and made me paranoid. Threatened to evict my grandmother and mother unless she stopped allowing the homeless squatter on property. 

Came to the city and tried to get a job anywhere 

Mcdonalds, Call centers, insurance sales, grocery store anything to get away from this business and nobody will interview me let alone hire me Except to be a pissant rent a cop again.

This isnt a profession it's a goddamn joke. 

I'm a goddamn joke who is amounting to nothing. I'm broke all my money goes to rent. I'm eating once a day. My gym clothes are ruined so I might not even make training this weekend

I'm fucking 30 and have done nothing in life but fail. And all anyone does is remind me.

I cant sleep. I cant breathe. And now as I look at the time I have 3 hours until I have to go to unpaid training for a job I've done my entire adult life and DO NOT WANT ANYMORE. None of this is worth anything anymore. 

I just want to die. I JUST WANT TO DIE.",Suicidal

I don't have the balls to tell the girl like that I like her. I don't want to exist. I wish my parents didn't migrate here so they wouldn't have met each other. They might care for me but I don't. I'm just a big burden. I wish I had a gun. Shooting myself in the head would be so easy. I hate everything I say and do. I can't sleep at night. I hate this.

"Chronic and Sustained Isolation (23M)* Every time I see someone's Messenger texts and how many people they talk to, it hits me

My isolation has reached it's breaking point. I don't think I can live in a world where I'm so different from every single person around me. So unfit and tossed aside. So resentful. It seems a bit like a war. Like a race. Them vs me.

It's almost always been this way. I've never seen it different.

Just to be clear, I don't think having someone to talk is going to help me, but it's more so dealing with the feeling of how different and unlikable I am. Furthermore, talking to someone who has all the things above really ruins the relationship between us, due to resentment. Anyways, I don't really see a path.

Thanks for any help in advance.",Suicidal
"HelpNot really serious about suicide (at least right now), but figured that I could always use some help. So here I am, half the world from where everything meaningful thing to me is for reasons I've recently lost my job, bill is starting to pile up, not sure if I can afford to stay here for any longer. If not, things is gonna get real shitty also for reasons. The only thing which has been keeping me moving is my parents and my girlfriend. I love my parents, but everything is so hard right now for all of us that maybe, just maybe, it would be better off without me. My girlfriend, we are half a fucking world away and since then she has been so fucking distant. I'm not a dumb little shit who doesn't realize what is going on here. I fucking know.

I'm not really trying to suicide when I'm writing this, but I've been thinking about it a lot. I haven't gone out in 3 days, and I feel like I'm hitting on a wall. Everything I'm doing now is so fucking terrible just cause my mind is full of shit. Just looking for a place to pour this all out.",Suicidal
"this is my titleso honestly i debated even posting here for a while. i rlly dont need someone calling a fucking ambulance to my house but here goes. yeah im suicidal have been for years i grew up in a shitty home and now that im outta that situation im still facing the everyday battle of moving on from that. never rlly had too many friends but  the ones i did have were kinda shitty i got 2 good ones now but there scarce in general, im a transgender that might be some of the reason for my depression. never truly being able to love yourself. family is scarce as well my grandmother is trying her best but i can feel her getting more jaded the more shes around me, im not religious at all i cant force myself to believe something that is so obviously false. ive tried therapy for 5-6 years (obligatory my opinion) therapy in the city is fucking cancer. i tried online therapy but apparently i got too close to my therapist not in like a creepy way just as friends, but that was too much. i have ptsd from past traumatic experiences with my parents, relationship wise i havent been as lucky ive been cheated on beaten almost raped multiple times. i would open up and talk about this to my friends, but theyre guys they just dont understand. girls dont like to talk to me. i think its because i may be trans but i still like girls so that may be quite creepy at times to other people, this is just the tip of the iceberg but im tired of typing. evrything is just numb these days. i lash out at the only people trying to help me and feel shitty about it later. im so down on myself. even when i try not to. i honestly just want someone to hold me. i want to cry but that just doesnt happen anymore",Suicidal

"God I can really do it this timeI'm not sad, I'm so pissed. 

I just got into a HUGE argument with my long distance ex-boyfriend who broke up with me because I have the misconception that most white people have racist views. And instead of talking about the issue with me, showing me what I'm thinking wrong, and understanding for a fucking MINUTE that my views extend from all my self-loathing and anxieties all he cared about was telling me how wrong I am until he basically said he told me to fuck off.

I'm very far from a perfect fucking person. But when you tell someone you never loved anyone like you love them, would never leave them EVER, talk about how devastated you would be without them then tell them to screw off because they a fucking social outcast that has a malinformed and maladjusted way to dealing rejection that's a new fucking low.

I can't trust ANYONE. And I will never trust another motherfucker. All I want to do is bleed and get out of this piece of shit world where everyone is a LIAR and user.

"Standby?I know someone who owns a shotgun and has been suicidal for years. He recently told me that he doesn’t think he can make it to the end of 2019. He hasn’t replied to my messages since, I know he didn’t do it, because he wouldn’t do it so soon, but he is going to do it very soon. I last talked to him a few days ago. Is it wrong that I messaged a company that he worked for and gave his name telling them a warning? He programmed this companies website or something. Is that none of my business? Is it wrong for me to do that? And last if all, if he does commit suicide, will I be to blame because I’m the last person he’s talked to?

"Who do you talk to when you don't want to talk at all anymore?I've been sitting here staring at a blinking cursor for almost an hour because its hard to think of the right things to say.  I think I've reached my breaking point.  I'm 26 years old and have battled depression all my life.  My family moved around a lot and I went to 12 different schools all together so I have no home and no real friends, just acquaintances.

I remember the first time I wanted to stop living.  I was 8 years old.  My parents did nothing to try and help me.  Their idea of support was to yell at me until I stopped showing any emotion at all.

No one has any idea of what I've been going through all my life.  I'm so tired all the time.  All I do is sleep.

"Pouring my heart out before the endHere's the brief history of me before I cease to exist.

Born in Arizona to military family. Immediately moved to Hawaii. Went to preschool and kindergarten there. Also got Crash Bandicoot trilogy for the PS1 from my Hawaiian Studies teacher. 

Moved back to Arizona for elementary school. Can't remember much besides the best golden retriever ever. Also break my wrist riding on the handlebars of Sister 1's bike. 

Moved to Southern Virginia. Mom went crazy from sometime around here due to a severe case of glaucoma. She quit her job and sat at home. She's doing better, just got a new job in her 50s. Sister 1 got a little Yorkshire Terrier, skipped a bunch of hillbilly high school to watch Maury and try drugs. She's doing better. Golden Retriever suffered through puppy Yorkie while she slowly died from cancer. We put her down instead. I miss you G, you were the perfect dog and I should've loved you more. 

Moved to Northern Virginia. Went to middle school and high school here. Mom and Dad both deployed. Sister 2 got into heavy drugs. Friend went to mental institution. Another friend committed suicide by revolver. I became deeply depressed and gave up my stupid dream of being a game developer. 

Junior year. Get super into drawing. Find Mark Crilley on YouTube. Draw everyday. Fill up sketchbooks with depressing art and sexy anime babes. Realize I don't have what it takes to be an artist after years of little progress. Give up.

Graduate HS with advanced diploma. Go to community college and work at McDonald's part-time. Complete math and drop out of English due to conflicts between me and professor. Quit McDonalds after 3 weeks.

Spend 14-18 hours a day on YouTube. Hardly eat. Spend most time in bed. Masturbate profusely. Realize I'm on a fast train to nowhere. Try to join Air Force, fail 2 specialty tests and am told I will wait 6 months to ship and I'll get my job after BMT. Fuck that.

Enlist in army with bonus. Try to weasel out of it because I am a weak pathetic insect. Somehow pass. Get to job training. Like job. Pass #4 in class. Get to real army. Sucks terribly.

Go to behavioral health because I think about suicide constantly, don't clean room, rarely eat, don't sleep. Get fed some B's and given pills that didn't do anything for me. Try another psychologist. Same deal. 

Become dead inside and focus solely on job. Fast tracked on promotions. Waivered to E4. Graduated 17 out of 162 at NCO academy. Be on color guard.

I still fucking hate this lonely empty existence. I probably die from cancer anyways, 3/4 grandparents had it. Never felt loved, accepted, or had deep close relationships.

There's no point in living a life like this. It doesn't matter how good I am at my job, doesn't matter what my college degree is.

I'm sick of being a ghost in this world.",Suicidal
"It's back.It's been months ago since I seriously thought of ending my life. I've been depressed for more than 5 years but I never bothered to get myself solutions until recently, which was 6 months ago. I went to therapy for about 2 months but I had to stop due to logistical reasons. I found a replacement therapist but I cancelled my appointment the last minute. I thought I was getting better -- I'm going out more often, I'm more willing to meet and trust new people, I'm starting to like myself again, I'm functioning like _normal_. But I viewed everything through rose-colored glasses. I'm not getting better. I didn't get any progress. I didn't gain friends. I've built this delusion of belongingness and family that I thought I've steered away from the demons in my head. They're still here. They never left and I just made things worse. I hate myself. My _friends_ are better off without someone like me in their life. The world is infinitely a better place without me in it. The voices are back and I just want them to stop. ",Suicidal
"The inertia's finally running outI've spent the last 2 or so years suppressing my desire to kill myself, to finally die and not have to deal with any of this shit anymore, and I don't even know why. I don't know why I've kept going until this point, other than the fact that I'm too poor to buy a gun. I dream about it. I fantasize about it. It's the only remaining thing I have to look forward to- my job is a dead end, I'm not going to college, I have no real friends, nothing to make me want to stick around. I'm beyond the point where this is just a quick escape from a bad situation- my life has been shitty and pointless for years now and I'm sick of coasting along just because I can't bring myself to do anything else. I'm unwilling to put the time and effort into spending years in college to maybe change something, or to try and find a new shitty job that pays just as little that amounts to nothing more than a change of scenery, or to find someone to talk to about this to try and hear them explain why my life is a precious thing I shouldn't waste or some shit like that.  I'm just sick of this. There is not a single aspect of my life that appeals to me in any way any longer, and I'm tired of staying in a world I don't want to be part of just because it's expected of me. I just want to end this, I've dragged it out long enough already. I don't stand to gain anything by continuing in this grain, all that'll happen is I'll just postpone it even longer. 

Hell, I don't even know why I'm bothering to post this, because at the end of the day I'm just gonna force myself to go to work in a few hours like nothing's wrong, then come home to dream about finding a loaded gun again. I don't want to be talked out of it, I don't have any way to do it in the first place. I guess I'm just doing this because this is the kind of thing suicidal people are supposed to do.

I've barely started this game but I'm going to permanently log myself out of it for eternity. I've decided to leave a vast note behind for anyone that wants to understand why I did what I did. It might be extremely confusing and out of the ordinary for most people, but that is how my thought process goes. 

I'm getting strong medication from someone that attends the same local public high school as I do. I have my parent's alcohol to consume that will counteract the drug to make death more probable. Overdose is not the safest and easiest way to go, it's actually pretty idiotic, but it will have to do. Nothing can fix my situation. All other avenues are not approachable or helpful. ",Suicidal
"Feel like I lost myselfThis past year has just been really hard. I started as a straight A student and am now failing all my classes.

I nearly overdosed on cocaine. I got caught up in prostitution, and drug production. I've last track of all my friends. Now all I'm surrounded by are people who just want to use me. I let them because I don't have anyone else. I don't know how to escape it all. This week I'm getting a draco. I just feel so lost in this mess, and I don't have anyone to turn to. My family kicked me out when I was 14, this gang has been the only thing there for me over the years. If I leave I'm leaving the only people that have been there for me over the years.

You can't find my reason to live for me.

But I can't find it for myself.

I sought respite in selfless service and found it to be unsatisfactory. I sought respite in expressing myself artistically and through creative endeavors and soon it all went gray. I keep seeking, even if it's only small steps for one simple reason.

"What's happening to me. All of sudden I realize I don't want to live. The many things I've tried to sweep under the rug are staring me in the face.I'm in my mid-twenties, male, short stature. I feel so sick lately. I admit I haven't had a good amount of sleep due to nightshift hours, but my negative thinking (which is not so usual for me) have been immense. 

I recently quit weed and alcohol after years of abusing it, mostly in isolation. During this time my ex gf made many attempts to reconnect with me and even more so recently. We hung out a bit, then I let it go. I just sat in kind of wait for what would happen, knowing I was too scared to make a move. Mainly because she took a very healthy turn in her life in the years we had apart and I really didn't. She just got a new bf and though I want her to be happy with a good person, I came to realise she was one of the best people in my life, more caring than anyone else I've know. My short stature does make it harder to simply find an S/O, confidence was my game with women but I've lost it. Re-built it many times, but now I have no energy left.

I'm eating healthy, going to the gym, working, just not coping at all. Sleep is difficult, I stay awake because I'm scared to close my eyes and have suicidal thoughts. I'm strongly considering smoking weed again an accepting my fate as a low-life because I don't have much going for me.

I feel like I tick many boxes of a person who commits suicide.

* Mental issues
* Unsteady employment (have not kept a job for longer than 9 months)
* Un qualified in any field
* Relationship problems
* Was emotionally abused growing up
* Drug/alcohol abuser
* Isolation
* The big 5: neuroticism, agreeableness, openness, extraversion, and conscientiousness describe me perfectly


All these things stacked against me confirms that this is not just a small feeling that will pass. It's the beginning of something. I feel like I am in very deep. I have feel-good moments in the day, but I want to end my life because the suicidal thoughts/ideas are unbearable. 

I want to see my gp. Last time I was prescribed anti-depressants they made me feel much worse.

As I said I want to just smoke weed again. I've smoked weed since 16 and it has got me through all this shit. It did make some things worse - losing lisence, expelled from school, losing gf, family fights. I just can't win. Smoking weed with someone helps, on my own not so much.

I don't want to leave my brother. He struggles with depression too. He's an awesome guy and has done everything right. I can't bare to cause immense pain to my family, especially not him. It's the last thing he deserves. He's what's holding me back from this. But the immense pain and lack of solution is making me crazy.. I just want to feel good about myself and life again. I want to have ambitions and confidence again. To speak clearly and be assertive again. I feel like I've slipped away completely and will only ever ""cope"" with my new-found reality. I was deluded before, now I see the picture properly and it's too hard to look at. 

I have many regrets. People say look to the future and not the past, but in my past I was so misguided and my actions have directly hindered my ability to have an organised, easy-going life. 
I'm scared and I don't know what else to do. I can keep going for now. I'm just scared if this keeps up I will not be able to go on, especially come birthday time etc. I lost many friends, I emotionally my hurt family, I can't bare this shame and regret.",Suicidal

"Now what?It has been about 2 years since my wife developed a drinking problem. It is the strangest thing. She doesn’t even drink a lot. She has as little as a small grass of wine and becomes Mr. Hyde. She has been abusive to our three children and myself during these episodes. She has been hospitalized for the drinking and mental health issues on two occasions. We have been together for 15 years. I love her. Damn do I love her.

Starting in early February I tried to leave on a couple occasions. On the most recent occasion, I slept with a woman other than my wife for the first time in our relationship. It was fairly good sex but shortly after parting ways for the night it occurred to me that I don’t want to sleep with anyone other than my wife. Sex without love just doesn’t seem worth it. I love my wife. I went home. Things were good for a week or so.

We had been dealing with a stressful housing situation for several months and that finally ended. We had a day off together. The kids were in school and we just spent the day together in bed. No sex just being together. It was great. The next day she went to work and had a glass of wine at lunch. Mr. Hyde came home and we argued. I tried my damndest to keep her together but she left. Took a cab to her mom’s and called me a couple days later begging for another chance. I told her that I loved her and that I would always give her another chance. She said her mom would bring her home the next day. The next day came and she wouldn’t answer the phone. She text me that night to say that she wasn’t coming home. She said she was tired of disappointing me and that she knew deep down that she would never stop the drinking. I drove down to her moms house to find out she went to his house.

He is a person she had described as her little brother. He was a part of a friends group she ran with as a kid/teenager. He has spent 12 of the last 15 years in and out of prison. Forgery, car theft, burglary, aggravated assault and theft round out his activities. These days it isn’t hard for inmates to get cell phones and 2 years ago I noticed that she posted this on his Facebook.

“Miss you! Thinking of you all and I hope you are doing okay. I dreamed of you last night, so I hope all is well. xoxo”

I thought that was inappropriate for a married woman to send to another man and I asked her to stop talking to him. She agreed and complied for a couple years until he was released on 2/17/2020. She started talking to him at work or when I left the house. I found out but she just reiterated that he was just like a little brother. When I found out that she went to him. I lost it. I drove to California and got stupid stoned. I walked a hole in my thighs pacing miles down the beach. She called me right as I got back in my truck. She called me a coward for leaving the kids with her mom. Ran me down some more and guilted me into returning to northern Arizona. I got home at 3am. She was sleeping next to her phone and I picked it up, read her text to him and knew they where romantic. I woke her. She told me it was over. I begged. She was steadfast. I told her I couldn’t live without her. She was steadfast. She ran out of the house and I walked away, got in my truck and called the Suicide Prevention Hotline. (what a joke that is) They sent the police to the house and she tried to coax me home with the police listening in on speaker phone. I knew better and drove to Phoenix. I had a plan but didn’t want to die. I love myself, I love being a husband and a father. This was 2/25/2020.

She told me she was going to focus on herself. Learn how to be independent. We met when she was 18. I was 21. She had almost no life skills. I pretty much raised her. She was a ward of the state and her parents never prepared her for life neither did the state. She spent most of her teenage years in juvenile prison. She moved into a shelter in Northern AZ and I lived in my truck in Phoenix. The shelter kicked her out for testing positive for drugs. She pawned our kids off on her mom and moved in with him. Our business was over now as a result of all that had happened and I got a physically demanding job. I slept in my truck, showered at the gym and busted my ass. We talked. I tried to be a friend to her. I need her in my life. One night while I was working she called me and I walked away from the line and hid while talking to her. He pissed her off and she ran to me. I told her I would do whatever I had to do to get her back. We ended the conversation with 30 or so I love you’s back and forth. The next day she said she had no memory of that conversation. She was blacked out. I was doing okay before that. Then I was crushed. Again. She text me later that night to tell me that our 13 year old daughter had stole her grandmas pot and given it to my wife. I called my daughter on my lunch break and she told me that my wife had put her up to it. Going so far as to boost my daughter into an unlocked window to go get this pot. Who was this person? It was totally out of character. I turned her in and went and got my babies. That was 3/7/2020.

It was easy to pretend to hate her after that. I felt better about having lost her as she wasn’t the same person anymore. I ignored her texts. I made arraignments for my daughters to stay at their respective best friends and my son and I stayed with a friend. Last weekend she called me to ask if I could locate her phone. She got into it with him. Left his house, drank a half gallon of vodka and somehow fell and broke a rib. Come to find out he was pushing her to file for divorce and she wasn’t ready. My mother-in-law told me that this asshole used to beat his mom. It has become obvious that he is trying to isolate her. He is pretty much going through the check list of shit that abuses do to trap their victims. I love my wife.

I don’t know what to do. My job is on hiatus because of Corona. My wife is wrapped up in a psycho. My kids are begging me to fight for full custody. I’m basically homeless. I’m suicidal. I need to run. If I keep doing this I’m afraid I will kill myself or him. If I leave her the kids and run they will hate me and probably end up in state custody. I want to run. I’m useless to my kids like this.",Suicidal

Basically I'm thinking of every possible way to die because this is bullshit I'm so sick of feeling like this and there's literally no point to life. Like I just don't give a fuck anymore. Nothing is going right for me. I have no friends. I have no family that loves me. I have nothing. I'm broke, got kicked out the other day, living on the streets, seventeen.

"(15f) i don't know what to do anymorefrom an open perspective, my life actually looks pretty good right now. i have decent friends, i'm going to a good school and not failing, and i have access to technology. compared to most people, my life doesn't seem that shitty. but sometimes, the expectations simply overwhelm me. i want to work hard for my parents and my siblings so that they can retire peacefully

my parents expect me to be the very best by getting all A's and doing well in the SAT, which is only normal for a parent to want. it's just so hard to be good for everyone else. i can't anymore. at this point, i'm not motivated to try and it's difficult to do simple tasks like waking up every morning. i was clean from self-harming for almost 4 months, but everything changed in the summer. now i can't go a day without self-harming or contemplating suicide. 

i just don't want to be a disappointment. it's so fucking difficult when you get critiqued for everything you do. when people ask me how i am, i always say that i'm tired. i'm tired of having to live in a repetitive cycle of bullshit, unable to fulfill anyone's expectations of me. i'm so damn tired. not only am i not good enough for other people, i'm not good enough for myself. i don't have the right to feel this way when there's others with more difficult situations. 

i don't know if it's worth it to suck it up and live for the sake of my friends, or just selfishly end it all. i attempted twice, it didn't work out, and now i'm just lost.",Suicidal

I have no more motivation from anyone or anything. Life is just a burden, and I’m just waiting for an accident to happen. 

My mental state is going crazy, I’m too young to get help, but my parents don’t care.

I had a therapist, but I realized that they are not what I need.

I’m too much of a cowardly introvert to seek help without the knowledge of my parents.

It seems like this is it for me, because life has just stopped. 

I have now gotten memory loss so I don’t remember anything from my past. And a wall in my brain prevents me from imagining my future.

"End of my ropeI'm literally sitting here staring at the rope, already knotted to where I would go unconscious before I would suffocate, and wanting to just be done with it all. I've been chronically sick the last few months that has left me in pain despite being in and out of the hospital over it, my dead end job where I'm working a job a couple pay grades above me without the actual pay, and just tonight my husband of 2 years decided he hated me over the fact I have to sleep more lately from the illness so I can work which means I don't always wake up for our little girl when she wakes up in the middle of the night.

I'm done with my chest always feeling like its on fire or being slowly stabbed. I'm done with having no respect at my job. And I don't want to even feel the pain of the man I love so deeply hating me for something I can't control.

edit: because of you guys, I was able to put my rope away and go to bed so I could get up a couple hours later for work. while nothing changed at work, Hubby and I were able to work something out so I wouldn't end up like I did last night.",Suicidal

"Do you think some people are never supposed to exist at all?In terms of eugenics or whatever, I feel that some people, such as myself, were never supposed to exist and would be doing the world a favor if they ended it. For clarification, I was born with a craniofacial anomaly where my skull plates were fused together at birth, otherwise known as Saethre-Chotzen syndrome. As a result, I have slight hearing loss, a small jaw, a horseshoe scar from both sides of my skull and extremely low self-esteem because my face is not perfectly symmetrical. Even if I didn't suffer from clinical depression, I feel that I should never have been born because people with genetic issues are deficient and are not supposed to procreate, for fear of passing on that gene that makes them deficient. 
Furthermore, for over half my life I have felt that I was never supposed to exist and have contemplated suicide since before I was 12 ( I am now a month away from my 24th birthday) and my family is riddled with mental and substance abuse issues on both sides. 
I have no discernible traits or talents aside from my ability to read books and analyze tv. I have attempted to date people from dating apps but I haven't been able to find the right people and I am convinced that if I were to survive another 20 years or so, it will be as a completely single person, possibly with multiple cats. I have had friends in the past, but they have all left me, possibly knowing how crazy and weird I truly am. 

Basically, I have almost always known that I was going to die by my own hand and within the past year have come to terms with the fact that I will end everything after my grandparents pass, which will most likely be in less than five years. This makes sense as they are the only people who have truly been able to care for me as parents should. My biological father has never been able to be there for me and my mother has tried in her own way but sees her children as people who have an obligation to take care of her, and bail her out,  even when she messes up her own life due to the fall out from being addicted to drugs and alcohol for so long.",Suicidal

I ruined my life and there's no point anymoreMy compulsive lying and mental instability ruined my relationship with the only person in my life I love more than anything.

However, I had a massive mental breakdown at some point, and I started opening up about my past, and the fact that I have depression. I told her that I want to end my own life once in a while and she said to me ""Okay, Anon (I'd prefer to not have my name out here), you scare me."". I felt fine for a while about her since I apologised for acting weird.

 However 1 month later she is not responding to my text messages or calls at all and seems to have gone silent, 2 weeks after that she responds to me saying that she has been cheating on me for 1 month... It broke my heart and I went on an episode of smoking, doing drugs and drinking, and now I feel empty. The one girl that made me happy... gone.

"People have abused, neglected, suppressed my potential to such a degree that in the future i'd probably consider murdering a person.Emotional abuse of a child is commonly defined as a pattern of behavior by parents or caregivers that can seriously interfere with a child’s cognitive, emotional, psychological or social development.

Stimulation of children in early development stages forms their character for the future. With weak mental stimulation, there is poor mental development in children, resulting in problems like poor school learning, lower intellectual ability, unstable emotional reactions and many more. Additionally, intellectual development is affected by the traits exhibited by the parents.

Talking to children provides one of the most effective forms of stimulus for child mental development. Research has shown when parents interact with the child a great deal; there is better cognitive, social and emotional development in children, leading to better skills at mathematics, enhanced reasoning and self-expression.

I feel like mental and emotional under-stimulation combined with abuse have severely damaged my cognition and sense of well being. Memories of being neglected, taunted, and abused other the years has driven me to insanity. A couple years ago while i was working i became increasingly unhappy and began to develop chronic sleep deprivation while I was working and a had a complete psychotic breakdown, almost schizophrenic like episode and nobody was there to help me. My coworkers took advantage of the situation and only helped to make my breakdown of reality more robust and extended. After the breakdown happened and i returned to reality and coworkers only ramped up the abuse and neglected, no compassion, not even an acknowledgement, nobody even talked to me about what happened to this day. I had a complete psychotic breakdown and not my friends, parents, or coworkers even acknowledged or talked to me about what happened. Completely neglected. 

I've been neglected and abused my entire life. If i mentioned a problem i was having while growing up, i was ignored.

"Pictures at the mallI’ve realized that I want to take some portraits at the mall for the purpose of an obituary. A nice headshot that looks like me, so my loved ones won’t have to search for one.

"Type 1 Diabetic and wanting to die.So yeah in the title it kinda says what I am. I've been trying to off myself ever since I was a little tyke back in middle school but to no avail. I've kinda just sat back never really talking to anyone but using videogames as sort of a vent to make myself feel like something. Being good at a game or becoming immersed is what helped me get through a lot of things. I've just felt that sitting around building up medical costs has been dragging me down super hard. I've never had a job or anything to make money because I always get super nervous when I walk into interviews and I beat myself up for it all the time. I should already be out of my mom's house out on my own, but I don't have a car nor can I drive. So I can't really drive to a job or go to college and I'm pretty sure I'd become a nervous wreck anyways. I've also never really taken care of myself for my diabetes, which has made me become incredibly aware that my body will probably start to break down on me very early before any of the few friends I have start to go. I don't know, just being a ""useless loser"" as I put it makes me not want to be around as I feel like I waste the money, time, space, and food of everyone around me. It also doesn't help that I never talked to anyone who I'd want to be in a relationship with. I'm gay and would really just like someone to stop and care for me, but I know that sooner or later they would be fed up with how useless I am. Anyways I've been contemplating whether or not I should off myself out where I am now; at some farm in the middle of nowhere. My mom decided she wanted to move in with here boyfriend in the middle of nowhere and since I had no one who wanted to take me in I had to go. Now I sit here typing this alone. I'm pretty sure they both realize how useless I am and I'm not sure what they'll do about me. It really just helps me to type this and ask for people to shoot the breeze with since the internet is so bad out here I can't talk to my friends or play any games to help me relax and vent. It just seems like my whole life will be like this and there's no escape. I mean I've though of just up and leaving one day and walking and just going until I decide to stop but I just don't know. Doesn't really help me either knowing that 3 months ago I tried to OD on insulin and woke up in the hospital and now I've got like $2000 in medical bills straight out of highschool with no way to pay them. I'm sorry if this is too long but I'm just confused and not sure what to do and it really helps to vent this because the only people who've known my motivations were my couple closest friends.",Suicidal
"I just want it all to endWhere do I even begin.

I've been in a long distance relationship for the past 3 years and we've been married for the past 2. My husband is living in India and we're waiting for his visa to come through. We applied in 2018 right after the wedding and we're still waiting for a decision. We've tried everything we can to get a quicker response and now they're straight up ignoring our emails.

Our relationship was perfect at the start. We understood and supported each other. I had a horrible childhood and was very depressed when I met my husband, and meeting him was the best thing that happened to me. I started flourishing at work and even became a bit more outgoing. But the longer the visa took, the worse our relationship is getting. I am snapping at the smallest of things, we're fighting almost every single day. I turned to food and Amazon for comfort and ended up gaining 20kg and my room now belongs in hoarders and my bank account is empty. In the past year, possibly the most important man in my life, my grandfather, passed away. This was the tipping point for me. Since then, I've completely shut down from my social life, I stopped caring about work, and I've lost all motivation to get up in the morning. I was traveling to India every few months over the past year and I got pregnant but had a miscarriage. I tried counseling for a while but it wasn't really helping. We had finally decided we're done waiting for the visa, and I'd quit my job and was going to travel to India in April. But then Covid happened, and I have no idea when I will be able to travel again. 

In the past few weeks, I've realised how much I've ruined my husband's life. I've been very stressed and depressed in the past year and taking it out on him. He was an extroverted, happy go lucky type of personality. I'm making him cry almost daily now. Ive ruined our relationship to the point my husband is afraid to even tell me a joke because I might take it the wrong way. And what do I do? I accuse him of being too controlling when he's just trying to help me. He's been trying to find a solution for my Amazon addiction and I'm just accusing him of taking over my finances. He's trying to help me get into a healthy routine and asking me questions to get me to communicate but I accuse him of not trusting me to do things etc. We just had an argument where he was trying to say he's just using the freedom we have over each other to help me and I just told him that since we're not living together, he has no right over me. He basically just told me he's given up. 

I hate what I've done to our relationship and to him. I hate myself for being this way. I don't want to live knowing how much I've hurt one of the few people who actually cared about me. I've come very close to slitting my wrist a few times in the past few weeks because of the constant fights (which progressively gets worse each time). Something always just stops me last minute, I guess just thinking of the pain or worried about my brother finding me(I'm living with my parents) and how it will impact him, or just worried that I'll survive and have to face everyone after. Today I had the blade to my wrist but then I just imagined all the blood and how it will be hard to cleanup for my dad and found myself looking up less messier and faster ways and found my way to this sub.",Suicidal

"Need some help on thisSo I've been looking at my best options with the main points being : accessible to me (no guns for example), high success rate and painless.
Here are the options I consider : 

A: 2.000 mg of Ambien 
+ Absolutely painless 
+ 100% success chances
- very expensive ~600 Swiss francs (literally all the money I have left)
- have to import it so might have extra costs and might be stopped at the Swiss border 

B : suicide bag with helium
+ Unconscious so painless
+ Very accessible just need to get some helium
- seems a bit sketchy, not much data about this method, so high chances of failure

C : jump from a high building
+ Easy to do an free
- not sure if I have access to a high enough building, and if I fuck this one up I'm very fucked

So what do you think, wich one should I choose ? Is there a good one I missed ? Is one of them a particularly bad option ? Suggestions ? Thanks for the help ! (Btw I don't wanna kill myself right now I just wanna have a plan in case it gets very bad) please comment",Suicidal
"I will be free this weekend.I don't know why I'm even bothering to post on here, but I don't have anyone else to open up to so here I am, I guess. I've been depressed for 7 years now, and this past year has been the worst. 

I've never really liked who I was as a person, I'm fat, ugly, untalented, socially awkward, incapable of getting a girlfriend...the list just goes on. I tend to stick to hobbies/things that I feel like I'm good at, but I tend to shift away from them after not too long cuz I just realize that I'm completely shit at everything. I just can't do anything right. The only thing I'm good at is school at this point, and I'm losing passion for the very major that made me go to school. I'm in a great school (top 10 in the world for my field of engineering) and have a good gpa, but I feel like I've given up everything to get there. And I'm realizing that I'm really not that smart...i'm just good at school. And not only that, but being the socially awkward fuck that I am, I can't really get back into being social. I'm a horrible mess, and I hate being me.

This past year has been rough because I lost my best friend. Long story short, I ruined the friendship, and she's moved on. I still open her snapchat stories, crying and reminiscing about how things once where. She was the only one I've ever opened up to. We were best friends for 6 years...and she's gone. I don't know how to live like this.

Sorry if this is getting long...I'm just miserable. I'm going to blow my brains out with a shotgun this weekend, same way my father died years ago. I'm empty and dead inside and I miss my bestfriend. I'm sorry, Sara. I know I promised you that I would never do this, but I can't. Please forgive me..",Suicidal
"I've been considering it for the last few weeks, and I've tried about a dozen times. I think I want to do something more intense and let the story end.I'm 24 years old. I turned it back on Nov 25. I've been suffering from depression since I was born, and it has slowly drained my energy. I was diagnosed with Aspergers and knew it for year beforehhand, but I don't think I ever learned how to deal with people properly. I'm a self-harming masochist that gets driven wild from bleeding myself. I have no friends as I alienate them with my needs for help and I've gradually learned that no one -really- wants to help a dysfunctional mess like me. Back in 2017, my partner of 11 years (is it weird that I've had a full lover for half my short life?) agreed to marry me after years of pestering since I was shitty teen, but I honestly don't feel anything anymore. Just that leaving this life behind would hurt him so so much, but might be ultimately best. I've been a drinker for as long as I can remember, since 2nd grade when I learned most of my classmates didn't understand that I was ""sad"" all the time.

I've been rethinking of ending it all. I get tired of life's ups and downs. While a millennial, I feel like I wasn't properly prepared for constant disappointment. That no one told me about depression, anxiety, anger, alcohol abuse, and the pain of this. No one told me how to deal with mental health issues my whole life and that I'm not able to be regular. That I need medication to finally not feel like a waste. That being in this group has gsneralised me to being ""the reason America has gotten weak,"" despite being from a small farm about 10 miles from Edenbridge.

I've downed 10(?) full shots of 95% Everclear and I just don't know what's the point anymore. My parents are sleep, and I could just drink until I end. I could take a bath with my toaster, borrow and eat someone's gun, cut some inches deeper, anything. I don't want to do this anymore. I don't want keep wasting everyone's time because I'm trying to figure myself out on someone else's dime. I'm sorry to say this, but even once I sober up, I just want to die.",Suicidal

"I’m pathetic and I hate myselfI don’t want to do this anymore. I don’t know what’s wrong with me or why I’m like this. When I was younger I was really outgoing and friendly, but now I’m socially fucking inept. I don’t talk to anyone or go out. I have declined every invitation for over a decade, so no one bothers to invite me to things anymore. I don’t answer my phone. I don’t respond to texts. My only close friend since high school (I’m 24) was online and he has moved on to real life friends so I’m just completely alone now. I don’t know how to talk to people. I don’t like being drunk or high because I feel paranoid and out of control and like I’m going to do something embarrassing. I don’t even know what people my age do together anymore besides go out drinking. Anything I can think of to go out and do for fun requires at least one friend to be with me and I don’t even have that. I just moved far from home because I thought it would force me to get out and meet people, but now I’m even lonelier than before because I don’t even have my family around. I just sit in my room watching Netflix and eating. I’m pretty sure I have binge eating disorder because all I want to do is eat all day long.

Why do I feel like I have to have a skinny body or an hourglass figure? I never though insecurities about my appearance could take such a toll on my heart, but it does. These thoughts follows me constantly, to the point where looking at myself in the mirror fills me with anger. I'm hideous. I'm just not enough, and I don't know how to get rid of this feeling.

"Does the pain ever end and will I ever find satisfaction and be happy. That’s really all I want. If not, I feel like just quitting.I have always felt inadequate. I grew up in a very strict religious home. My father was a baptist pastor and I “accepted Christ” at 5 or 6. Whether I fully understood it, I don’t know. But I do know that as I grew older I always felt like a “bad Christian” and a let down, especially as i explored sexuality. Basically my preteen and teenage years were a combination of a pure fear of death and a utter guilt of my sexuality. 

As time grew on, I became addict to porn and masturbation. Which ad life developed and time took its toll; my mother died at the age of 21 and  I found solace in porn, bdsm, and fetish. Which did not align with my spiritual beliefs. 

To compound on top of my mothers unexpected death, I dealt with I now realize as being serve depression as a teenager, beginning with my first break up at 16. I used to play with my fathers loaded revolver and lay in bed and imagine writing my note. 

As I progressed into my twenties my porn “addiction” or dependency increase so did my guilt and shame. I eventually lost my virginity at 22, the ultimate black mark as a Christian, or so I perceived it. 

Depression still sever. I fucked as many women as possible. I was in therapy and SA (an anonymous 12 step) several times with no relief. I found the most wonderful and beautiful woman I have ever met to this day, I still day dream about her. She Broke my heart after 4 months of dating and preparing for engagement  and left me for her ex-husband, she was only 24 at the time. 

Time passed, I stayed depressed, thought I might have been gay/trans and my therapist diagnosed me as a sex addict as a 14 on a scale of 20. Lots of money spent on chats and p2p sites. 

In 2018 I met a girl on a hook up, and I thought she was my savior. I professed love within 3 weeks. We were engaged yesterday.  But yet I was online chatting and sexting women today. And trans women a month ago. 

I’m so depressed. I feel as if I’m an awful person. A despicable person, an atrocious Christian, and a shame of lover/fiancé. There’s been days leading up to the engagement, I’ve just wanted to leave her, but we moved a thousand miles away from where we lived to be close to her family, and I feel I’m in too deep now to do anything  but marry her. But there’s fucking shit that drives me insane about her.

Here I am again. A day our engagement, thinking about and planning my own death, somehow that I avoided 2 years ago drunk at a dam with a bottle of whisky and a glock.

"How do I go about dealing with poor mental healthThis is going to be a long post so if you read all the way through, thank you. 

The past two years I have been struggling with anxiety, depression and bouts of suicidal ideation. I was doing okay this past semester, but these last few days have been really rough on my mental health, and I planned out a suicide attempt which made me realize I desperately need help. The suicide hotlines are useless, and I was just denied online therapy. I am a low income student so I of course do not have insurance, and because I’m only taking 6 credits this semester, I don’t qualify for my schools mental health services. I just don’t know what to do. I can’t afford any sort of therapy (I’ve checked every nearby therapist and they’re all over $100, even with sliding fee scales), and I don’t qualify for insurance. I just feel lost. I don’t have any family or friends to fall back on, and this particular year has been awful on me. Do any of you have some advice? I’m trying to get into law enforcement after graduation (not policing), so I’m scared of being diagnosed with any sort of mental illness. But at the same time, I feel that therapy and possibly medication would really help. However I don’t even know where to start on that since I can’t even pay for the initial appointment.

My doctor doesn’t think I’m unhealthy enough to qualify for ODSP, but the thought of trying to work the kind of job I could get with my skills makes me want to kill myself even more. My boyfriend thinks I get upset over everything, and was literally laughing at me earlier today when I complained that something he said felt objectifying. I can’t get compliments out of him without dragging them out practically by force, which feels both abusive on my part and in-genuine on his, unless it’s something about how fat I am (apparently he likes that). I’m been in my undergrad for 5 years now, and I have yet to get through a semester where I haven’t had to ask for an extension, not to mention I’m taking a part time course load so nothing I actually do achieve feels like it’s my own. It’s a shitty major anyway, that will never get me a job, even to the point where people laugh at me for having thought that getting an arts degree would actually be useful for anything anyway. My body is the wrong shape, too masculine, and nothing I can ever do will change that. I never succeed at anything I do with anything like the competence I need, even to the point where I honestly don’t believe anymore that I’m capable of succeeding in anything – everyone is always faster, smarter, prettier, more knowledgeable, funnier, more creative, more energetic, more stable… People almost never reach out to me, and seem uncomfortable when I try to reach out to them. I’m a useless waste of oxygen and I just haven’t got the strength to go on telling myself differently when the whole world (except maybe my counselor) seems intent on proving to me just how worthless I really am. Even if I wanted an extension on my assignments at this point, it’s so close to the end of the semester they couldn’t grant one to me. I don’t have the money, time, energy, or willpower to properly take care of myself, and even getting out of bed is… well I don’t want to, I don’t want to have to face another miserable fucking day on this planet. Christians tell me that I’m an aberration against god and that I’m going to hell because I defied his plan for me (by changing gender) – well, I’m already IN hell, it can’t possibly be any worse than this, and what kind of a god does that to people anyway? Society is so fucked up with people campaigning against rights and freedoms (see Stephen Harper, Vic Toews, the entire conservative caucus bursting into laughter at the idea that trans-people deserve equal rights, not to mention Romney getting almost half the American vote, the Golden Dawn party in Greece, unemployment in Spain, legalized murder for being different in Uganda…) I don’t want to be with a guy who dislikes me, but then I’m left with no-one at all.",Suicidal

We were together for 6 years and lived together for about 4 of them. She was my girlfriend, my friend, my everything. I feel ashamed because this is almost a cliché by now (hey fucking girlfriends, man!), but yeah. I'm not saying that is the main reason for my mental state at the moment, but it is a very big part of it, in that, she was the one I talked about all my other problems. While life wasn't perfect by any means, I had her to talk to. Now I miss her trust more than anything, it's like I lost my closest family member. We went through so much together and we know each other better than anyone else, at the moment at least. She blocked every kind of communication medium with me. It's like she killed me inside her. I just don't know where to turn to now. I'm really confused, even as I write this. It's like this is the pinnacle of a number of issues that had been dragging for some years - there is so much I've been through that is contributing to my current state of mind that I honestly don't know what to talk about. I'm in a breaking point of loneliness, regret and guilt.

Sorry for my awkward english. Hugs.",Suicidal

"Going to make it as easy as possible for my familyI'm 34 and I honestly didn't think I would be still here. I day dream about a natural disaster, a military attack or an incurable disease taking me out. It would be so much easier, but since that isn't going to happen I'll just have to start planning my exit. One of my concerns was leaving an even more stressful situation behind for my family, so I am going to continue downsizing all of my belongings, pay down car debt, clean my vehicle with a detailed instructions on how much to sell it for to pay for my cremation and then I would like to write a few final letters. I think it's important to help with closure to at least write to the important people in your life or just a few words explaining why it had to end. 

I was born in negativity, raised by a chronically depressed Mom, felt unwanted by my Dad, always attracted to horrible women that bleed me emotionally dry and I'm done trying to find a decent woman to share my life with. A woman isn't going to make me happy, it's always fleeting and the love is one sided. I'm tired of working my ass off just to make pennies and barely afford to survive. 

My goal in life was to buy some land, build a home, grow my own food, get married, have kids, but I don't think I am meant to have that kind of emotional security or support. I do enjoy traveling, so I might plan a trip and just lay down on the ground, look up at the night sky and do the sleeping pill route. Nature can just reclaim my body.",Suicidal
"I'm uniquely fucked up and I'm genuinely backed into a corner.Almost 17, I'm that damn young and I've been like this for ten years, they feel so long and so short at the same time
I've been suicidally depressed since I was 7, I've talked myself down multiple times, my memory isn't great but as far as I can remember, I first started to have psychotic symptoms at the age of 15, I'd been having huge mood swings from depressive to pretty happy I think, I'd want to do certain things and be fairly productive, recently these mood swings are from complete despair to slight depression yet somewhat productive and outgoing.
Anyway, at the age of 15 my depression got even worse, I went out on night time walks and almost killed myself multiple times, I started to have delusions and I started to see and hear things, I had extreme paranoia, so much so that one time I duct-taped some soda cans to string and then taped those to the ceiling above my door so that while I was elsewhere in the house I'd know if someone broke into my room to hack my computer.
I started developing all kinds of delusions, ranging from the idea that I'd been poisoned with some kind of virus or disease to there being holes in the sky, I'd lost it.
I started to self-harm, one time I went outside and decided to bring my knife with me (which was illegal to have outside) I went to an abandoned park and sat down on a bench in the middle of the forest, shrouded in darkness, I cut for a while and then stood up eventually.
That's when I heard it, branches rustling, cracking, they started going crazy, as if something was sprinting through them, and then I saw IT, I didn't quite realize what it was then as I ran way before getting a good look at it but I'd soon see it again and again, it's a figure that's darker than the darkness around it, like a hole in space, it's the same height and build as me, it wears that same hoodie and cargo pants, it's dressed exactly like me, it IS me, it's some kind of dark version of myself, that's how fucking insane I am, I hallucinate a dark double of myself! Sounds like something from a movie or game right? I mean, I've looked this shit up, nobody has experienced anything like this and reported it.
One time the walls closed in on me, another I heard the sounds of some hellish dog right behind me, I had all kinds of insane hallucinations, I heard voices, faint but definitely there. I'd hear singing downstairs, I'd descend the stairs and it'd stop, nobody in the house would've heard it.

I came close to ending my life so many times, especially during that break when I was 15.

I tried to seek help but long story short I can't anymore, just please believe me on this, I can't get help, alright? Atleast just pretend I'm right or don't post, I can't get help for a multitude of reasons.
My paranoia had gotten really bad, I thought the government was after me I think, I dunno, it's kinda foggy.
I slowly got better, I still wanted to die and I still felt depressed but I found myself my purpose, my reason for being here, I followed it and then I failed, I just stayed in my room even more, stopped going out on walks even, I've been descending into the rabbit hole again, while I've been fighting off delusions with not too much trouble (Although I think I may have had one a month ago, only took me a couple weeks to snap out of it though, it being the first one in a good while to take a hold of me slightly and it was based on something slightly logical) 
I had a nightmare a few months ago and IT was there, I was scared as it'd never invaded my nightmares before, I started hallucinating again and my depression got even worse, I've started self harming again and my hallucinations are coming back, I spent Christmas eve outside in the dark and the cold wandering the streets alone, debating suicide.
I'm alone, always have been really, I've been drinking to cope with things, I keep hoping it'll leave me foolish enough to kill myself, I've been cutting again and it's worse than ever.

I honestly feel like a fraud, like I'm lying or exaggerating all of this for attention when I know I'm not, I don't want attention, I don't even know why I'm posting this.
Most of the people on here don't want to die, if their life got better that'd fix things, they want things to get better but they just don't see another way out other than suicide.
I want to die, I don't want things to improve, I want to die, I think I've grown attatched to my depression for some insane reason, the emotional pain is genuinely like torture, I can hardly distract myself anymore, each day is just hell, I want to fucking die, I genuinely have no reason to keep going but I keep having this part of me that keeps trying to crawl forward, to keep fighting, I don't know why I still fight.
I don't think I can fight the psychotic symptoms anymore, and especially not the depression, I can't take it anymore, I really feel like I've had my fill.
When I was 15 and had that first psychotic break I used to wander the streets and just stare down groups of thugs (I live in a shitty area) I wanted them to kill me, I was hoping glaring at their leader would make them try to stab me or something yet they fucking don't, they always looked away and ignored me, they seemed scared, I'm only 6'2! Seriously, I was like 6'0-6'1 when I was 15, why the hell would they be afraid of me!? 
I can't stand seeing IT and I know that I will see IT again and I fucking can't deal with that, I can't deal with the hallucinations and I worry the delusions will grab me again, that delusion I may have had a month-ish ago I don't think was one, but I may be lying to myself, I mean, I thought someone was stalking me, I thought someone was after me, all because I saw the same red car a few times, all because he/she stuck their hand out of the window and did some kind of wave at me, it was near christmas, they were probably just saying hello or something.
I'm losing my mind, I can't take this shit anymore, I'm homeschooled but I've been not doing anything for a long time, I can't fucking take this shit anymore.

I'm gonna drink a few more shots of vodka, self-harm some more and maybe take some pills (not a lethal amount, just enough to fuck me up without hospitalizing me) I don't know why I wanna do damage to myself.

I thought I'd gotten past all this, I knew I was still depressed but I genuinely thought I was past this.

I've been drinking, I don't know how much I've left out, I know I've atleast not said half of the shit that's wrong with me (Oh yeah, I'm serious) 

I don't think I'm bipolar or schizophrenic, I'm nowhere near that bad right? I mean, I'd have constant hallucinations, not just a few a week or something. I mean, I guess I could have bipolar or schizoaffective or something but as I said, I don't think I'm hallucinating enough for that and my ""up"" phases aren't exactly manic, but what do I know? 

I genuinely can't get help, believe me on that, even if you don't, pretend you do. I'm debating killing myself in a couple weeks or a few days or whatever, I dunno, I really don't, I have nothing and nobody to live for and I've been doing this dance ten fucking years, I'm sick of talking myself out of it, what kind of seven year old is suicidal!? Anyway, I can't fucking take it anymore. 


TLDR: 16 years old, almost 17, been suicidally depressed for 10 years with mood swings, has hallucinations and sometimes delusions, I see a dark version of myself that stalks me around and I've been drinking and self-harming, I've been self harming a while though. 

PS. I'm legally allowed to drink at this age where I live, alright? I don't want people yelling at me about that, I also may have typed complete gibberish and may have multiple grammar mistakes due to me drinking heavily.",Suicidal
